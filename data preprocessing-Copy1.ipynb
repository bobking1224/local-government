the polish legal system a person who holds a public function may be held criminally liable for passive bribery bribe accepting defined in article  of the polish penal code pursuant to article  §  pc a public officer and persons belonging to several other categories are persons holding a public function while article  §  pc defines the public officer by detailed enumeration of specific persons among individuals related to local government the category of public officers covers council members employees of the local government administration unless they only perform support activities certain other persons who have the authority to issue administrative decisions on the basis of a special provision as well as employees of the local government audit body apart from public officers the category of persons holding public function related to local government include some other types than councillors members of local government bodies and some persons employed at units operating with the use of local government funds at their disposal provided that such disposal is of a publiclaw nature studies on judicial practice in cases of bribery and corruption do not yet provide data that would allow for a precise determination of the scale of corruption in local government but there can be no doubt that passive bribery committed by local government people is not a minor phenomenon

journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law  introduction the correct operation of local government relies on a number of factors including criminallaw response to pathologies this study concerns local government body members and local government employees as passive bribery offenders under polish criminal law polish criminal law provides for two complementary types of bribery active and passive active bribery in its basic type is defined in article  §  of the act of  june  the penal code consolidated text journal of laws of  item  as amended hereinafter referred to as the penal code or pc as a conduct involving the granting or promise of granting a financial or personal benefit to a person holding a public function in connection with holding this function but it must be related to the function that this person performs the perpetrator is subject to the penalty of imprisonment for the period of  months to  years the basic type of passive bribery is defined in article  §  pc the penalty of imprisonment for a period of  months to  years is imposed on a a person who due to the performance of a public function accepts a financial or personal benefit or promise thereof this issue is the subject of numerous studies in polish subject literature there are a number of studies the older works of a spotowski spotowski  and m surkont  have largely lost their relevance however there are newer monographs by c nowak  p palka  m iwański  t kanty  numerous articles and some commentaries to pc the query reveals serious differences of opinion regarding the understanding of the definition of a person holding a public function which means the need for further research in this regard  methodology the study does not cover the analysis of statutory criteria of passive bribery in the basic type and in numerous modified types contained in article  §  to §  pc it is supposed to determine to what extent an employee of local government in the republic of poland may be a perpetrator of active bribery and therefore to what extent can be considered a person holding a public function within the meaning of article  pc to achieve this goal the classic formal and dogmatic method was used as the prevailing methodology it has been employed to analyse legal regulations regarding the notion of a person holding a public function the results of case file research on passive bribery in some categories of local government employees was presented as auxiliary research material lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law   analysis of the problem the penal code of  in its original version used the notion of a person holding a public function as an offender of certain crimes but did not define it it contained a definition of a public officer article  §  of the penal code which was the subject of performance of a number of criminal offences eg an active assault on an officer article  pc or impersonation of an officer article  pc because at the same time article  pc used the concept of a person holding a public function there were doubts as to the relationship between both concepts to eliminate these doubts the act of  june  amending the act  penal code and some other acts journal of laws  item  defined in article  §  pc the concept of a person holding a public function a person holding a public function is a public officer member of a local government body person employed with an organisational unit which holds public funds unless the person concerned only performs support activities as well as another person whose rights and obligations in the field of public activity are specified or recognized by law or an international agreement to which the republic of poland is a party it should be noted here that the previous doubts have not been dispelled and even new ones have arisen nowak  p  this is not the place for a detailed presentation of the historical development of regulations relating to bribery it should be emphasized however that the indicated act of  june  was a breakthrough this act did not fundamentally change the regulation model which falls within the scope of the standard according to which the definition of the perpetrator of passive bribery is the scope of duties of a person holding a public function and not the formal name of function therefore the polish model of responsibility for passive bribery can be described as broad as opposed to the narrow model in which the relationship of the bribe with the undertaking of specific actions by person holding a public function is needed iwański  p  article  §  pc stipulates that all persons classified as public officers are also persons holding a public function therefore the analysis should be started with a casuistic definition of public officer under article  §  pc the provision mentions the president of the republic of poland a member of the sejm a senator local council member and a member of the european parliament the second group comprises persons related to the judiciary a judge juror public prosecutor officer of a financial body for preparatory proceedings or its superior body notary bailiff probation officer insolvency administrator judicial supervisor administrator an adjudicating member of a disciplinary authority acting under a statutory provision the third group is related to administration it includes central government or local government personnel employees of another state body unless they perform only support functions persons who under a specific  lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law provision of law have the power to issue administrative decisions to the extent to which they are authorise to issue them the fourth group is those in a managerial position in another state institution the fifth is the officers of an authority established in order to protect public security in addition public officers include prison service officers employees of state inspection bodies or local government inspection bodies and persons in active military service of the first of the above mentioned groups the focus of this study is on the local council member for the second group since the act of  november  on local government personnel consolidated text journal of laws of  item  this concerned a disciplinary body adjudicating member but this act abolished the disciplinary liability of local government employees giętkowski  p  the third group includes local government administration personnel unless they only perform support activities there is also another person to be considered from this group who under a specific provision has the power to issue administrative decisions these are certainly not members of the fourth group but rather those in the fifth for which the status of officers of bodies appointed to protect public security should be considered other persons include employees of a local government inspection body certainly the group of public officers comprises members of the municipal council poviat county council and regional assembly article  of the act of  march  on municipal selfgovernment consolidated text journal of laws of  item  as amended article  of the act of  june  on poviat government consolidated text journal of laws of  item   of the act of  june  on regional government consolidated text journal of laws of  item  the status of public officer is acquired by a local council member upon taking the oath at the first session of the newly elected council and terminate at the end of his term of office unless there are circumstances giving rise to the early termination of the mandate such as failure to make a declaration on assets on time giving up the mandate violation of the prohibition of combining the position held with the functions listed in statutory provisions incompatibilitas  loss of passive electoral law kanty  pp   the position of councillors of auxiliary units of the municipality raises difficulties the act on municipal government gives the possibility to establish such units in the form of rural communities settlements urban districts and towns which do not constitute separate municipalities article  of the act on municipal government such units include rural community councils settlement councils and urban district councils respectively an unusual solution has been provided for the capital city of warsaw article  of the act on the system of the capital city of warsaw of  march  consolidated text in journal of laws of  item  provides that the urban district council is the legislative and audit authority for the district article   of the act stipulates that the regulations lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law  concerning members of district councils of the capital city of warsaw shall apply accordingly this is what makes them public officers not the circumstances pointed to by kanty that these people are appointed as a result of election and that the act directly refer to them as council members kanty  p  there are no grounds to consider members of rural community councils as public officers pursuant to article  of the act on municipal selfgovernment the council supports the activities of the village leader and has no legislative powers unlike the urban district council and settlement council therefore urban district council and settlement council members of the district may be considered council members within the meaning of article  §  pc while members of rural councils may not kanty  p  article  of the act on municipal government stipulates that the legislative body in an urban district settlement is the council of this unit while article  provides that the statutes of the settlement may stipulate that the legislative body for the settlement is a general meeting of residents therefore the urban district council member is a public officer and the settlement council member is a public officer if the settlements statute does not provide that the general meeting of residents is its legislative body certainly in a situation in which the general meeting of residents is the legislative body residents do not become councillors in accordance with article  of the act on municipal government article  of the act on poviat government article  of the act on voivodeship government a council memberdue to the exercise of his mandate enjoys legal protection provided for public officers the reason behind this stated in the literature is the need to provide council members with protection against negative effects of their actions leoński  p  matyjek  pp    it is not very clear as article  §  pc explicitly recognises the council member as an officer so it is pointless to establish additional protection it may even cause faulty interpretations like the one stated under article  §  of the act of  february  notary public law consolidated text journal of laws of  item  as amended which contains an identical regulation based on this provision a position was expressed that the notary enjoys the legal protection provided for public officers but the notary himself is not a public officer within the meaning of the penal code as far as his criminal responsibility is concerned since article  §  of the notary public law constitutes a lex specialis with respect to article  §  pc redelbach  p  see also górski  p  this view if accepted would also apply to a council member it is nonetheless incorrect since the criminal law defines this term for its own use the use of definitions and terms contained in other normative acts is neither necessary nor justified giezek  p   lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law the most important group is local government personnel unless they perform only support functions this regards primarily employees of local government bodies these bodies are the municipal council and the mayor village mayor town mayor city president at the municipal level article  of the act on municipal government the poviat council and the poviat board at the poviat county level article  of the act on poviat government the regional assembly and the regional board at the voivodeship regional level article  of the act on regional government as regards these councils it should be noted that this does not concern council members who are either way public officers since article  §  pc expressly mentions them but persons employed in the offices to support the work of councils this group refers after all to employees ie persons who provide work within the meaning of the act of  april  the labour code consolidated text journal of laws of  item  as amended article  §  of the labour code stipulates that the employee is a person hired under an employment contract see daniluk  p  the council member is not such a person since the relevant legislation provides for incompatibilitas eg pursuant to article   of the act on municipal government the employment relationship in the municipal office in which the councillor obtained the mandate may not be established and if an official obtains the mandate of a council member he is obliged to apply for unpaid leave  p  therefore it is not about councillors but persons providing work for the municipal poviat and regional bodies dolnicki  p  judgement of the supreme court of  june  ii kk  lex no  also the authorities of intermunicipal unions and unions of poviats which may be established pursuant to article   and article   of the act on municipal government and article   of act on poviat government are rightly pointed out daniluk  p  article  of the act on local government personnel provides that the provisions of that law apply to local government employees employed in marshals offices and regional local government organisational units poviat offices and poviat organisational units municipal offices municipal auxiliary units municipal budgetary units and local government budgetary establishments offices or equivalent entities of local government unions and local government budgetary establishments set up by these unions as well as offices or equivalent entities of administrative units of local government units these are both employees hired by the local government body itself and those hired by the bodys auxiliary apparatus in the form of for example a municipal office poviat office marshals office dolnicki  pp    daniluk  p  majewski  p  this follows directly from article  of the act on local government personnel dolnicki  p  this category includes also employees of structures set up within the auxiliary units of the municipality lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law  employees of urban district offices are thus employees of local government dolnicki  p  local government employees employed in organisational units established by local government bodies to perform their tasks are also local government employees kanty  p  these units are established under various legal bases and their organisational form can vary they can be budgetary establishments budgetary units or commercial law companies in particular see dolnicki  p  in the prevailing opinion of local government labour law scholars there is a tendency to broadly understand the organisational unit within the meaning of article  of the act on local government personnel szewczyk  p  góral  p  et seq which affects the interpretation of article  §  and §  pc if an employee is employed with an organisational unit established by a local government unit that has legal personality it is deemed that the employee is not a local government employee dolnicki  p  employees employed at organisational units that do not have legal personality are local government employees under specific provisions this applies to eg employees of municipal budgetary establishments and local government organisational units of social assistance dolnicki  pp    an employee of the local government is also a municipal police officer kanty  p  but there is a doubt raised in the literature whether he is a public officer also on another basis as an officer of the body appointed to protect public security this issue will be discussed in detail below but it should be noted here that the view that the municipal police officer is not an officer of the body appointed to protect public security is right dukiet  nagórska   kanty  p  but differently garus  ryba  p  see also rogalski  p  szewczyk  p  persons who are not in an employment relationship and provide services to a local governmental entity under a civil law contract are not employees hence they are not public officers and persons holding a public function daniluk  p  local government employees should be classified as public officers and persons holding public functions but that this does not apply to persons who perform only support activities the assessment of how to understand support activities will be made further on in this study as it is rightly noted in the jurisprudence and scholarly opinion employees of local government appeal boards do not fall into the category of public officers these are appeal bodies in individual cases in the field of public administration falling within the competence of local government units article  of the act of  october  on local government boards of appeal consolidated text journal of laws of  item  and therefore bodies of second instance in  lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law administrative proceedings on matters falling within the competence of local government bodies their status is being questioned dolnicki  p  tarno  p  skibiński  p  article  §  point  of the code of administrative procedure hereinafter referred to as cap stipulates that whenever the cap refers to an administrative body it is to be understood as a number of bodies which are subsequently listed therein as well as local government boards of appeal the fact that the legislature has separated the board of appeal from the aforementioned local government bodies using the phrase including also means that the board of appeal was included in the category of these bodies only for the purposes of the administrative procedure dolnicki  p  skibiński  p  outside the scope of application of the cap they are not local government bodies therefore on the basis of article  §  and  pc employees of local government boards of appeal are not public officers or persons holding a public function decision of the supreme court of  june  iii rn  wokanda  no  item  daniluk  pp    concerning the persons indicated above article  §  pc stipulates that they are officers unless they perform exclusively support functions therefore performing exclusively support functions means that a given person cannot be a perpetrator of passive bribery the identification of support activities and whose responsibilities include performing such activities is a kind of core of the analysed definition examples of persons performing only support activities include a cloakroom attendant cleaner buffet attendants library employee security guard nowak  p  daniluk  p  majewski  p  departing from the meaning of the adjective usługowy service support in polish it should be stated that it is characterised by a feature of activities aimed at satisfying someone elses needs doroszewski  see also sobczak  p  however the purely linguistic meaning is not satisfactory as support activities are performed in a sense by all employees of the administration including local government after all they satisfy specific needs of citizens this means that it must be about something else the view that these are activities that do not fall within the substantive competence of a given authority which are of an auxiliary nature in terms of needs indirectly related to the functioning of the authority or unitmajewski  p  daniluk  p  is correct this gives rise to somewhat ambiguous conclusions with respect to certain types of activities for example under article  of the act of  december  on municipal management consolidated text journal of laws of  item  as amended the provisions on local government personnel shall apply to employees of budgetary establishments unless specific provisions provide otherwise this means pursuant to article  §  and §  pc that they are officers and persons holding a public function if they perform activities other than support activities ie those which fall within the substantive competence of the establishment with lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law  regard to a municipal public utility provider it should be considered that the activities which fall within the scope of its substantive jurisdiction are eg street cleaning waste collection etc this in turn makes it necessary nolens volens to assume that a cleaner employed at such an establishment is a public officer and is subject to special protection during and in connection with the performance of his official duties consisting in street cleaning and  being at the same time a person holding a public function  if he accepts a financial or personal benefit or a promise thereof in connection with his function he meets the statutory criteria of active bribery as defined in art  of the penal code this is highly unfortunate but it results from the very broad approach to the notion of public officer as defined in article  §  pc however the sharpness of this regulation is blunted by the provision of article  § pc according to which a prohibited act the social harm of which is insignificant does not constitute a criminal offence in most cases of accepting a benefit or its promise due to the actions of such an officer one should even speak about the lack of social harmfulness of the act rather than its insignificance article  §  pc states that also another person is a public officer to the extent to which the person is entitled to issue administrative decisions these are persons who operate within other selfgovernments than local government eg professional selfgovernment organisations of advocates medical practitioners kanty  p  surkont  p  or attorneysatlaw therefore this group remains out of the scope of our interest the fifth group of public officers included the officers of a body established to protect public security and public order this protection is the task of the central administration kotowski  p  osierda  p  as regards local government the issue of ensuring public security and order is of a secondary nature whereas article   of the act on municipal government provides that to the extent not regulated in separate laws or other generally applicable provisions the municipal council may issue law enforcement provisions if necessary for the protection of citizens life or health and for ensuring public order peace and security which means that it has tasks in this field however kanty rightly notes that this does not make the municipal council such a body within the meaning of article  §  pc since the security task in question does not involve performing such activities directly kanty  p    there is more doubt about the municipal police in accordance with article  of the act of  august  on municipal police consolidated text journal  item  is a selfgoverning uniformed formation set up to protect public order in the municipality there is no reference to public security originally the caselaw of the supreme court maintained that the municipal police was set up to protect public security resolution of the supreme court of  december   lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law case ref no ii kzp  orzecznictwo sądów polskich  no  item  the view was then changed considering that the municipal police was supposed to protect public order not security decision of the supreme court of  september  case ref no i kzp  orzecznictwo sądu najwyższego izby karnej i wojskowej  vol  item  the only point of attachment for the older view may be article   of the act on municipal police stipulating that the maximum working time of the municipal police officer may be exceeded where it is required to take measures to protect the life or health of citizens as well as the security of the community in particular the general threat to public security catastrophe natural disaster or terrorist offence it follows from the provision that the municipal police is required to take action in connection with the protection of public security this can lead to the conclusion that it is a service established to provide security however kanty rightly points out that the fact that a given service is obliged to act inter alia in the event of a security risk does not alter the fact that it is established to protect order kanty  p  the municipal police officer is not a public officer under a provision concerning bodies appointed to protect public security but under another legal basis as a local government employee as prejudged by article  of the act on municipal police dukiet  nagórska  p  kanty  p  but differently garus ryba  p  the last group to be classified as officers are persons employed at a local government audit body unless they perform only support activities the performance of such activities is discussed above the mere distinguishing of this group is rightly considered unnecessary as these persons are already public officers by virtue of being employees of the local government kanty  p  these are employees of the regional chambers of accounts which in accordance with article  of the act of  october  on regional chambers of audit consolidated text journal of laws of  item  are the state supervisory and audit bodies for the financial management of local government units the persons listed above are public officers they are subject to increased protection provided for in the provisions of chapter xxix of the penal code addressing offences against the activities of institutions of the state and local government in accordance with article  §  pc a state officer is also a person holding a public function ie a suitable subject of passive bribery the provision stipulates that the person holding a public function is a public officer a member of a body of local government a person employed at an organisational unit which has public funds at its disposal unless the person performs only support activities and another person whose powers and obligations in the scope of public activity are specified or recognised by an act or an international agreement binding on poland lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law  with regard to a member of a local government body it should be stated that this concerns various types of selfgovernment eg professional selggovernment filar  p  at this point we are interested in a member of a local government body though however it was stated above with respect to the council member that he is a person holding a public function as a public officer so it is not about him as noted above local government employees are also public officers however there are persons other than council members and employees in the local government structures who perform certain activities on a gratuitous basis in particular there are members of auxiliary bodies of the municipal government eg village heads and members of village councils they have a budget allocated by the municipal council which makes it right to classify them as persons holding a public function and thus create the possibility to be held liable for bribery kanty  p  iwański p  on the other hand failure to classify them as officers means that they are not subject to special protection during performing or in connection with their activities from the point of view of their duties they are treated in a special way but are not more protected than an ordinary citizen when analysing the notion of a person employed in an organisational unit operating with public funds one should start from the notion of public funds article  of the act of  august  on public finance consolidated text journal of laws of  item  as amended lists public funds in detail these are public levies and other revenues revenues from the european unions budget nonreimbursable funds from aid granted by efta member states funds from financial instruments specified in the provisions on the principles of development policy other nonreimbursable funds from foreign sources revenues of the state budget and budgets of local government units and other public finance sector units from various financial operations and finally revenues of public finance sector units from their activities and from other sources therefore they can be considered as revenues of the state and local government budgets the view that this covers also such assets as receivables real properties etc judgement of the appellate court of wrocław of  october  ii aka  orzecznictwo sądów apelacyjnych  vol  item  decision of the supreme court of  september  i kzp  orzecznictwo sądu najwyższego izby karnej i wojskowej  vol  item  guzik  makaruk pływaczewski  p  constitutes an inadmissible extending interpretation kanty  p  the concept of public funds comprises both the funds allocated to the state treasury and the local government the identification which units dispose of public resources requires that it be determined whether there are entities in which there is any contribution of public funds in this case local government funds or rather entities with the power to distribute those funds as an exercise of the powers delegated by the local government both these concepts are presented in literature  lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law and case law it is sometimes argued that a person employed in an entity holding public funds is for example a member of the governing bodies of a housing cooperative director of a stateowned enterprise a company in which the share of public capital is at least   a stateowned bank bojarski oczkowski  p  górniok  p  and vast case law doubts are raised by nowak  pp    in opposition to this view there is a position based on the interpretation of the term disposal of public funds referring to article  of the act on public finance which refers to the distribution of public funds clearly indicating that it is about planning the use of the public funds held that is to say an act within the limits of sovereign powers if that activity is carried out by an entity other than a central or local government body the entity acts towards the achievement of public objectives laid down by law in place of a particular public body in this case local government one it is therefore not an economic activity but administrative one kardas  p  et seq mik  p  kanty  pp    palka  p  article  of the act on public finance states that the public finance sector comprises  budgetary units budgetary establishments and auxiliary holdings of budgetary units special purpose funds and state or local government legal entities established under separate laws for the performance of public tasks excluding undertakings banks and commercial law companies but not all of these entities are involved in administration kardas  p  this may be the case in localgovernment budgetary units budgetary establishments and auxiliary holdings but the determination of whether an entity merely carries out an economic activity or whether its responsibility is sovereign planning on distribution of funds can only be determined on a casebycase basis it is likely that most of the entities referred to above are not such entities the expression which concludes the list contained in article  §  pc a person whose rights and obligations in terms of public activities are laid down in law or an international agreement binding the republic of poland  raises a number of doubts but they do not relate to the issue of selfgovernment this concerns clergymen who officiate clerical weddings with civillaw effects car diagnosticians academic teachers etc in more detail kanty  pp   summary the passive bribery offender specified in article  pc may be a person holding a public function pursuant to article  §  pc a public officer and persons belonging to several other categories are persons holding a public function among individuals related to local government the category of public officers covers council members employees of the local government administration unless they only perform support activities certain other persons who have the authority to issue administrative decisions on the basis of a special provision as well as employees of the local government audit body apart from public officers the category of persons holding public function related to local government lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law  include some other types than councillors members of local government bodies and some persons employed at units operating with the use of local government funds at their disposal provided that such disposal is of a publiclaw nature this approach raises certain doubts the attempt to define the passive bribery offender in a broad manner in the act of  june  amending the penal code and certain other acts combined with the pursuit of a precise enumeration of the persons involved has caused ambiguity in particular there are no uniform classification criteria nowak  p  this also applies to persons related to local government as demonstrated above studies on judicial practice in cases of bribery and corruption do not yet provide data that would allow for a precise determination of the scale of corruption in local government and interpretative doubts do not facilitate the evaluation of their results the study carried out by p bachmat in  shows that  out of  randomly chosen passive bribery cases  of all cases in  in  concerned the passive bribery committed by a person holding a local government function with  cases being persons who are undoubtedly within the limits of the above mentioned scope of meaning of a person holding a public function because once it was a municipal police officer twice it was officials of a poviat office  cases concerned a driving examiner in the voivodeship traffic centres who are local government employees teachers who do not fall into the category of a person holding a public function were sentenced twice bachmat  p  the small number of cases examined under the study does not allow for a full assessment of the phenomenon but it can be concluded that its scale is quite significant of course the conclusions of these studies can be deceptive p bachmat examined  of cases ie  out of  finally it turned out that in   proceedings were initiated in    in    in    in    in   in    in    in    in     accessed on   these are not significant numbers but on their basis it can be concluded that the conducted research covers few cases and may be affected by errors full conclusions can only be drawn from broader research that has not yet been carried out not only have the studies conducted so far examined few cases of passive bribery but have not made use of studies on active bribery granting a benefit or its promise there were  such cases in  bachmat  p  p bachmat examined  of them which is a significant number and which would enrich not only the knowledge about active bribery but also about passive bribery after all each act of granting a bribe entails its acceptance when examining active bribery it was not being determined who in the  cases under study the perpetrators gave the benefit or its promise ie who was potentially the perpetrator of passive bribery related to the active bribery this would have cast  lex localis  journal of local selfgovernment m kulik the local government body member and the local government employee as a passive bribery offender under polish criminal law more light on the shape of passive bribery perhaps it could provide an answer to the question as to why there are  cases of active bribery per  case of passive bribery when common sense indicates that the numbers should be similar cases that have been concluded with final decisions may explain the difference but this entails a sad conclusion that proceedings against the bribe provider are easier to conclude with a conviction than proceedings against the recipient of the same bribe from a practical point of view passive bribery committed by local government people is not a minor phenomenon from the dogmatic point of view it can be seen that the definition of the perpetrator raises serious doubts resulting from the adoption of the defective form of enumeration '"

      "he or she likes, at every day of the week and at every moment of the day (Municipality of Eindhoven,\n",
      "2014). In 2013 the Living Lab Stratumseind (LLS) was started as a part of the Stratumseind 2.0 project.\n",
      "The LLS has its own angle and scope, but it contributes to the broader goals of this overarching project.\n",
      "The LLS aims at three broad objectives (Van Gerwen, 2013a & 2013b, R1):\n",
      "1) Collecting facts and knowledge about different aspects that (possible) have to do with the\n",
      "liveability, safety and attractiveness of Stratumseind. With specific measuring equipment anonymous data\n",
      "are collected about the visitors of the street, the surroundings and the local circumstances. By\n",
      "measuring and connecting data of f.e. the level of noise, temperature, number of incidents, occupancy\n",
      "rate of parking places, number of visitors and the origin of visitors, a broad pallet of information\n",
      "is created. The data can also be used as a baseline assessment for trying to measure if a certain\n",
      "intervention has any effect in practice.\n",
      "2) Offering a platform for (scientific) research. The street becomes a testing ground for scientific\n",
      "research that looks at the influence of light on the behaviour of people (De-escalate project). The\n",
      "expectation is that the intensity and perhaps also the colour of the light used in public spaces will\n",
      "have a positive effect on the possible aggressive behaviour of people in a street. With the results\n",
      "from the living lab substantiated choices can be made with regards to the appropriate scenarios of\n",
      "the use of light for a better and safer experience of the visitors of Stratumseind. This can be done\n",
      "in a preventive but also in a more reactive way.\n",

      "goals that are stated in the Stratumseind 2.0 project. Partners of the LLS (entrepreneurs) that have\n",
      "an idea about the way to increase the liveability, safety or attractiveness of Stratumseind can test\n",
      "products, equipment, concepts and ideas in real life practice. This initiation role is important for the\n",
      "LLS because this kind of innovations increases the attractiveness of the street. It also broadens the\n",
      "scope of the LLS beyond measuring of data and it helps to make clear that the LLS is not just about\n",
      "safety alone. Examples of this kind of innovations are the use of big interactive display panels on\n",
      "the street and the development of apps like for example ‘pub advisor’ and ‘Feedback Stratumseind’.\n",

      "well as external information from different kind of sources, a lot of data is collected about lots of\n",
      "different aspects regarding the liveability, safety and attractiveness of Stratumseind. These data is brought\n",

      "be used to predict the behaviour of the ‘crowd’. They are also needed to evaluate specific interventions\n",
      "aimed at changing the behaviour of visitors. The image of the ‘Engine block’ is the second metaphor\n",
      "used by the lab manager to describe the way in which the LLS operates. R1 highlights that this metaphor\n",
      "means that the living lab also has the function of initiator for renewal and innovations in the area. Within\n",
      "the network associated with the LLS new ideas about the development of Stratumseind can be\n",

      "5.2.1. Sensors\n",
      "        A broad range of sensors are used in Eindhoven. Cameras have been positioned at the five entranced\n",
      "of Stratumseind. The video images are not preserved but they are used to count numbers of people.\n",
      "Specific software is used to convert the video images in information about the number of visitors to\n",
      "the area. Wireless noise detectors have been positioned at the same five positions as the cameras. The\n",
      "data from these detectors can be used to generate a three dimensional image of the noise in the area.\n",
      "In addition, light sensors for measuring light intensity are planned to be positioned at two or three\n",
      "positions. When a mobile phone has chosen to open its access to Bluetooth or wifi, a macadres reader can\n",
      "read the telephone’s unique code. Five readers have been positioned at the same places as the cameras\n",
      "and the sound detectors and since these readers work up to 150 meters, the whole area is covered.\n",
      "Social media analysis is also part of the living lab. In collaboration with a commercial firm, a web\n",
      "crawler has been developed to search for tweets and posts with search strings such as ‘Stratumseind’,\n",
      "‘Stratum’ and the names of the bars. The software analyzes these tweets to generate a sentiment analysis\n",
      "which indicates whether the posts are generally positive, negative or neutral. The perceptions of the\n",
      "inhabitants of the neighborhood will be measured on a weekly basis with a digital survey. This survey\n",
      "is meant to measure the subjective perceptions of the situation on Stratumseind. In addition, data about\n",
      "whereabouts of mobile phones are purchased. Aggregate and anonymized data about the town where\n",
      "people live are bought from Vodaphone. These data provide insights in the origins of the visitors to\n",

      "intensity). Twenty-eight lamps have been positioned in Stratumseind to influence the behavior of visitors\n",

      "developed that presents key information in an accessible manner. This app can be used by the police on\n",
      "the street and by the security of the bars on Stratumseind. In addition, a technology has been developed\n",
      "to control the effectors: the same app that provides information to the police and security can also be\n",
      "used to steer the light on the street.\n",
      "        Technologies are leading in this approach and surprisingly little has been thought about who is to use\n",
      "and control these technologies (R2). For some sensors this is quite clear. The local government can use\n",
      "the data about noise to plan its garbage collection and to inspect events and bars. Citizens can use the\n",
      "data also to inspect whether events remain within the legal noise levels. For most of the other sensors,\n",

In the conclusion, we raise questions concerning the strong focus on information as the key to a safer street and present an agenda for further research into the smart governance of urban safety.\", 'Information Polity', \". Introduction The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for urban safety has a long history. The notion of surveillance has been dominant in these analyses . Some authors have focused on Closed Circuit Television Systems (CCTV) and technologies for analysis of video material  and, more recently, new research has focused on the use of communication media for engaging citizens in the coproduction of safety . The research on cameras, surveillance technology and social media has provided important insights in new forms of surveillance – or sousveillance – in an information age but current developments require new attention. The new wave of technology integrates various sorts of technologies (cameras, noise sensors, social media analyses) and used advanced forms of data analysis to obtain relevant information and insights. These technologies are not only used in a centralized control room but also by networks of public and private actors that are engaged in the production of safety. New technologies and new forms of governance result in the promise of what can be referred to as ‘smart governance’: the smart use of new technologies by networks of actors to make cities safer. At the moment, however, our empirical knowledge about these new – smart – surveillance practices is limited. This paper, therefore, aims to explore how this promise of urban safety through advanced technology actually works out in practice and to explore the benefits and pitfalls of smart governance for urban safety. Rodriquez Bolivar and Meijer indicate that smart governance entails the use of ICTs for internal and external collaboration in government to realize societal value . This paper investigates smart governance empirically through an in-depth case study of practices of a ‘quantified street’ in the Dutch city of Eindhoven. In this city, the hometown of the lighting company Philips, one street is full of new technologies to make it safer and cleaner. A collaboration between the city government, technology producers, knowledge institutes and owners of bars and restaurants uses new technologies – noise detection, cameras, twitter analyses, data analysis – for instantaneous monitoring to make a busy night area in Eindhoven into a safer and more pleasant environment. These new practices take the form of a living lab that explores the possibilities of this wide range of new technologies. We conceptualize this smart street as a socio-technical practice since it consists of technologies, roles, organizations, rules, etc. This paper analyzes these practices to enhance our understanding of how technologies are used to enhance urban safety. Our main research question is: how and why is a variety of new technologies used to construct a smart street? The answer to this questions will shed some light on the benefits and pitfalls of smart governance and provide the basis for a more specific research agenda into these new collaborative surveillance practices. The academic relevance of this paper is twofold. This first ambition of this paper is to realize a systematic description of the new technologies that are used for smart governance of urban safety. The new uses of technology for producing urban safety are rapidly emerging but academic research has not yet provided a systematic description: there is a need for theory-based systematic academic descriptions of smart governance of urban safety. We will use the literature on cybernetics , crowd management , surveillance  to position these evolving socio-technological practices. This analysis contributes to the emerging body of literature on smart city governance  and (urban) surveillance  by analyzing a smart street and showing how this can be understood as a complex cybernetic system. The second part of the description is explanatory and aims to construct a theoretical understanding of the governance choices and emerging technological practices. The literature either presents smart governance as an instrumental approach to realize governance objectives or criticizes the neo-liberal foundations of these new forms of governance. An analysis that is based on a more sophisticated understanding of collaboration in the public sector is lacking. Building upon the four perspectives on governance developed by Bekkers , we will analyze the development of the smart street from different angles. These perspectives help to develop a rich account of the logics that have guided the development of the smart street. This contributes to the growing understanding of smart city practices as resulting from specific cognitions, interest, institutions and values rather than being inevitable outcomes of technological development . The paper is structured as follows. Sections  and  present the descriptive and explanatory frameworks for the analysis of the quantified street in the City of Eindhoven. Section  presents the research strategy and the research methods and in Section  we will present the case and analyze it with the use of the descriptive and explanatory frameworks. To conclude this article we will reflect on the case and draw some conclusions in Section . . Cybernetics as a framework for descriptive smart governance The literature on smart cities is rapidly expanding . Even though the term as such is still heavily debated, both technological and critical analyses of smart cities have been published. The basic idea of a smart city is that new technologies can be used to improve life in the city. Smart grids help to make better use of electrical power, transport systems aim to optimize the use of roads and smart apps provide tourists with information about sights. While many analyses of the smart city focus on the city as a system, some highlight that we also need to analyze developments at a more specific level. The smart neighborhood brings us to the level of technology for stronger neighborhoods and the smart street takes us to the level of a specific street in a city. The (limited) literature on smart street mostly focuses on the use of street lights to improve the use of energy and, at the same time, create more safety . The smart street can, however, also be viewed as a miniature smart city: the same logic applies but at a much smaller scale. The basic argument about the smart city – the use of technologies to measure everything with the aim of intervening more effectively – can also be applied to the street. This would mean that the street turns into a technological street full of sensors to measure what happens on the street. The street becomes ‘datafied’: everything that occurs on the street is measured and the data can be used for new interventions. A street can then be regarded as an urban laboratory to test and develop new technologies for smart cities . This view on the street as a site for experimenting can help to understand the logic of the smart street: a smart street is then not only a means to enhance safety and livability but also a test ground for new technologies to be applied at a larger scale. A key ideal in the smart street is prevention of criminal activities by creating an environment – in terms of light, smell and gaming opportunities – that is not conducive to criminal activities. The idea of inhibiting crime by changing the environment is not new: classical work on the prevention of crime through urban design was already done in the . Newman  highlights how strategies of (de) limiting movement, defining areas of specific sorts of activities and providing for visual surveillance are crucial to building a safe neighborhood and these ideas have been enormously influential in urban design and renovation. The specific feature of this approach in smart streets is that the environment is created dynamically by changing the effectors in response to measurements of street conditions. The basic idea of intervening on the basis of measurements in the streets is a cybernetic idea: the street is turned into a cybernetic system. For that reason, the cybernetic perspective can used to describe these emerging socio-technological practices. This type of perspective focuses on the information relations between an organization and its environment to study how organizations react towards changes, occurrences or incidents in the environment. Deutsch  emphasizes that governance requires information processing through sensors and effectors. Sensors are organizational functions – composed of technologies, organizational procedures, and organizational positions – that scan the environment for relevant information and effectors translate these signals into organizational action by formulating and enacting an organizational reaction. In addition, a control system is needed to coordinate the relation between sensors and effectors. The control function is needed to analyze the information that comes from the sensors and to control the effectors. An overview of the cybernetic model is presented in Fig. . The cybernetic perspective is a general perspective on government action but it can used to conceptualize government reaction to safety and security problems. The literature on crowd management emphasizes that processing signals that may indicate (future) problems is crucial to crowd management . The literature on crowd management aims to strengthen early warning systems that help the police and other government agencies to act quickly and to prevent or limit safety risks. In addition, the surveillance literature highlight that government uses a variety of informational means to observe society with the aim of being able to realize its policy objectives more effectively . The cybernetic perspective can form a basis for systematically describing smart governance. . Four perspectives for understanding smart governance The cybernetic perspective is useful for describing the smart street but does not provide the basis for developing an understanding of the emerging smart governance practices. A theoretical perspective is needed to develop an understanding of how and why specific forms of socio-technical collaboration between various actors are being constructed. Translating Bekkers’  perspective on policy-making, we can distinguish four different perspectives on governance: a rational, a political, a cultural and an institutional perspective. The key value of this perspective is that it facilitates us to develop an understanding of new forms of collaboration from different angles: rational choice, power struggles, meaning-making and rule following. These perspectives are not contradictory but help to develop a comprehensive understanding of how and why certain forms of collaboration between various actors are being constructed. The rational perspective conceptualizes governance as the outcomes of rational analysis. Governance plans and programs are seen as important ‘neutral’ instruments for realizing goals and the choice for a specific intervention is explained on the basis of the goals it aims to realize. The rational perspective stresses that an analysis assesses the relation between means to ends. The main criteria for evaluating the success of governance are efficiency, effectiveness and (internal) cohesion. Knowledge and information are very important within this perspective since they are essential to the quality and depth of governance plans. The main idea in this perspective on governance is that better information about a problem and the effectiveness of interventions will result in better governance. ICT’s are seen as neutral or value free instruments that could more or less be used ‘of the shelf’ to strengthen governance. The political perspective departs from the viewpoint that governance is the result of a trade-off between different important values. Power protects or imposes certain stakes and positions or ideas. Choices are not made on basis of a rational analysis but subject to a permanent struggle between actors. This struggle takes place in arenas or governance networks in which the different actors are interdependent. Strategic behaviour and the use of power are part of everyday reality. Governance instruments are therefore not neutral but important sources of power that can be mobilized to realise certain advantages. The most important criterion for the evaluation of governance is stakeholder support and ICTs are not neutral instruments but symbolic resources that are used strategically to impress relevant stakeholders . Governance, in this perspective, is not the result of rational analysis but of political interactions . The third perspective on governance that Bekkers discerns is the cultural perspective. Central is the idea that governance is above all sense-making between stakeholders. Governance is seen as a social construction that results from the interaction between different stakeholders (see also ) and certain meanings and interpretations are coagulated in governance arrangements. Based on processes of framing and reframing, actors try to build a common understanding. Within this perspective, governance is not only conceptualised as ‘language’ but also as ‘images’. The main instrument is the organisation of an ‘open’ dialogue which can lead to a collective learning process. Whether governance is considered a success depends on the degree in which stakeholders are successful in developing a common, shared understanding of the character and the size of the problem at hand and the possible solutions for it. Storytelling is important in bringing order because different realities are connected to each other into a shared reality . The last perspective is the institutional perspective. This perspective conceptualizes governance as the result of a combination of practices, values, rules, routines, conventions and processes that were shaped and made in the past. Because of this, there is not much room for making new choices in governance. In line with the sociological perspective , Bekkers sees institutions are sets of formal and informal rules that shape the behavior of social actors. These institutions such as the rule of law condition the behaviour of individual organisations and in this way they contribute to the predictability of their behaviour (see ). Information systems can be seen as the embodiment of solidified definitions of reality and items or issues that are not registered in these systems are therefore seen as not important. Furthermore within this perspective it is also important to look at the rules that determine how, in what way, knowledge and information should be shared or exchanged. There are two criteria for determining the level of success of governance: the logic of consequence (focus on efficiency and effectiveness) and the level of appropriateness (legitimacy) (see ). Characteristic for this perspective is ‘path-dependency’: a new governance approach tends to follows the footsteps of earlier developed and implemented approaches since switching costs are often high. The perspectives on governance are complementary rather than competing ways of understanding social reality . A combination of these perspectives can be used to understand the smart street as a socio-technological practice that is constructed on the basis of actor preferences, strategic behaviour, sense-making and (institutional) rules. . Research methods This paper explores the topic of smart urban safety governance through an in-depth case study. The selected case should be considered as a most advanced case in terms of use of new technologies for urban safety . The involvement of high tech companies such as Philips and top knowledge institutes such as Eindhoven University of Technology makes for innovative use of new technologies. The results of this case can by no means be generalized to other cities and other policy domains but provide insights in new developments that will possibly also play a role in other cities. The case study is based on interviews and document analysis. The interviews started with the civil servant who manages the Living Lab Stratumseind ( May ) and proceeded through snow ball sampling. The selection of respondents will be ended when no new names are mentioned by the respondents. This resulted in nine extensive – often more than two hours – interviews with key participants. In addition to the managers of the Living Lab Stratumseind, the following interviews were conducted: the director and an advisor of the key consultancy firm ( August ), the key civil servant of the City of Eindhoven ( August ), the responsible alderman of the City of Eindhoven ( October ), an independent project consultant ( February ), the contact person at Philips ( February ), the principal investigator at Eindhoven University of Technology ( May ), the owner of a bar on the street ( December ) and a citizen who lives there ( December ). The interviews are referred to with , , etc. In addition, we analyzed all the available policy reports and documents. Documents were retrieved both through the interviews and through an Internet search on the term ‘Living Lab Stratumseind’ on Google ( August ). The number of policy documents was surprisingly limited and this may result from the fact that in an urban laboratory there is more focus on experimenting than writing policy plans. Our search for relevant documents resulted in three policy documents, three website and one newspaper article (see list of documents). The research started with a reconstruction of the development of the Living Lab Stratumseind over time. The reconstruction focused on the role of the various actors, their cognitions, their value orientations and objectives and their strategies . The respondents were asked to recount the origins and development of the Living Lab Stratumseind and to reflect on their own role and the roles of the other actors. In addition, the respondents were asked about current practices and the specifics of the various technologies used in the living lab. Additional information about current practices was obtained from the documents. This data collection was structured by a cybernetic focus on signals, sensor, effectors, controls and effects . The data were analyzed at the level of the socio-technological practices to describe the use of systems and their embedding in the organization. In addition, the data were analyzed on the basis of the four perspectives on governance to develop an explorative understanding of the choices made in this process of using a range of new technologies for smart urban safety governance. .

Eindhoven has developed into a city of . inhabitants and it is one of the leading actors in what is called the Brainport Eindhoven Region, which is considered to be the centre of technology in the Netherlands. In this city, Stratumseind is one of the most important nightlife areas in the city of Eindhoven. It is the longest ‘pub’ street of the Netherlands where you can find over  pubs, café’s, discotheques and restaurants located in one street. It is well known for many years now, but the last couple of years Stratumseind faces some challenges that have to be met. Not just with regard to safety, but also with regard to cooperation and economic viability. That’s why the city of Eindhoven has started the Stratumseind . project in which the local authority works closely together with businesses, the police, breweries, the owners of the real estate property in the street and local residents living on and around Stratumseind. The main goals of Stratumseind . are making this specific area more liveable, safer and more attractive for visitors as well as for businesses. In one of the plans it is formulated that Stratumseind should be a vital street focused on entertainment in which everyone that is young at heart can find something that he or she likes, at every day of the week and at every moment of the day (Municipality of Eindhoven, ). In  the Living Lab Stratumseind (LLS) was started as a part of the Stratumseind . project. The LLS has its own angle and scope, but it contributes to the broader goals of this overarching project. The LLS aims at three broad objectives (Van Gerwen,  & , ): ) Collecting facts and knowledge about different aspects that (possible) have to do with the liveability, safety and attractiveness of Stratumseind. With specific measuring equipment anonymous data are collected about the visitors of the street, the surroundings and the local circumstances. By measuring and connecting data of f.e. the level of noise, temperature, number of incidents, occupancy rate of parking places, number of visitors and the origin of visitors, a broad pallet of information is created. The data can also be used as a baseline assessment for trying to measure if a certain intervention has any effect in practice. ) Offering a platform for (scientific) research. The street becomes a testing ground for scientific research that looks at the influence of light on the behaviour of people (De-escalate project). The expectation is that the intensity and perhaps also the colour of the light used in public spaces will have a positive effect on the possible aggressive behaviour of people in a street. With the results from the living lab substantiated choices can be made with regards to the appropriate scenarios of the use of light for a better and safer experience of the visitors of Stratumseind. This can be done in a preventive but also in a more reactive way. ) Creating an environment that gives a boost to innovation. This innovation is needed to reach the goals that are stated in the Stratumseind . project. Partners of the LLS (entrepreneurs) that have an idea about the way to increase the liveability, safety or attractiveness of Stratumseind can test products, equipment, concepts and ideas in real life practice. This initiation role is important for the LLS because this kind of innovations increases the attractiveness of the street. It also broadens the scope of the LLS beyond measuring of data and it helps to make clear that the LLS is not just about safety alone. Examples of this kind of innovations are the use of big interactive display panels on the street and the development of apps like for example ‘pub advisor’ and ‘Feedback Stratumseind’. For some of these innovations the lab works closely together with other organizations like students of the Fontys University of Applied Sciences. Two metaphors were developed to describe what the living lab is about (; Municipality of Eindhoven, ); the ‘basecamp’ and the ‘engine block’. The ‘basecamp’ (also referred to as ‘board computer’ or as ‘measuring station’) refers to the fact that by using sensor technology on Stratumseind as well as external information from different kind of sources, a lot of data is collected about lots of different aspects regarding the liveability, safety and attractiveness of Stratumseind. These data is brought together so that different kinds of analysis can take place. These kind of baseline measurements will then be used to predict the behaviour of the ‘crowd’. They are also needed to evaluate specific interventions aimed at changing the behaviour of visitors. The image of the ‘Engine block’ is the second metaphor used by the lab manager to describe the way in which the LLS operates.  highlights that this metaphor means that the living lab also has the function of initiator for renewal and innovations in the area. Within the network associated with the LLS new ideas about the development of Stratumseind can be generated. The engine block function of the LLS means that this living lab is supposed to actively create and support the idea of community building among people that can contribute to innovation. .. Describing the Living Lab Stratumseind from a cybernetic perspective While the two metaphors provide insight in how the participants view the living lab, the cybernetic perspective can be used to describe the socio-technological practices in Living Lab Stratumseind from a more systematic perspective as a cybernetic system consisting of sensors, effectors and controls. ... Sensors A broad range of sensors are used in Eindhoven. Cameras have been positioned at the five entranced of Stratumseind. The video images are not preserved but they are used to count numbers of people. Specific software is used to convert the video images in information about the number of visitors to the area. Wireless noise detectors have been positioned at the same five positions as the cameras. The data from these detectors can be used to generate a three dimensional image of the noise in the area. In addition, light sensors for measuring light intensity are planned to be positioned at two or three positions. When a mobile phone has chosen to open its access to Bluetooth or wifi, a macadres reader can read the telephone’s unique code. Five readers have been positioned at the same places as the cameras and the sound detectors and since these readers work up to  meters, the whole area is covered. Social media analysis is also part of the living lab. In collaboration with a commercial firm, a web crawler has been developed to search for tweets and posts with search strings such as ‘Stratumseind’, ‘Stratum’ and the names of the bars. The software analyzes these tweets to generate a sentiment analysis which indicates whether the posts are generally positive, negative or neutral. The perceptions of the inhabitants of the neighborhood will be measured on a weekly basis with a digital survey. This survey is meant to measure the subjective perceptions of the situation on Stratumseind. In addition, data about whereabouts of mobile phones are purchased. Aggregate and anonymized data about the town where people live are bought from Vodaphone. These data provide insights in the origins of the visitors to Stratumseind. The department Intelligence of the Eindhoven police provides the police reports about Stratumseind. Respondent  – the project manager – would like these to be more specific to know where exactly incidents took place but he thinks this will demand to much from police reporting. Data from the garages in the area provide information about traffic flows at certain times and number of visitors who go to Stratumseind by car. The Municipal Cleaning Department provides information about the amount of waste and glass collected at Stratumseind per day. The beer breweries who provide the beer to the bars provide information about the beer consumption. The public events calendar provides insight in specific events in the city that may have an impact on the number of visitors or the timing of their visit to Stratumseind. This list is not complete since other open data from the city such as counts of the numbers of cyclists can also be used to monitor Stratumseind. ... Effectors A variety of technological effectors is used to improve urban safety. The first one is light (color and intensity). Twenty-eight lamps have been positioned in Stratumseind to influence the behavior of visitors through their color. These lights can be directed at the level of the individual LED. The second one is smell. The possibility to influence people through smell has been explored with a small company (Smartnose). This company wanted the LLS to pay the development of an application and therefore this option has not yet been developed any further. The third one is gaming. The idea is that games might distract people and move them away from trouble. This idea has not yet been developed. In addition, traditional intervention through police action can be used to act upon the information that is gathered through the various sensors. Interestingly, this line of action has hardly been developed within the context of the LLS. ... Controls Various technologies are used for data analysis and visualization for control. Tools for big data analysis have not yet been developed but the Eindhoven Technological University, the Fontys University and the Police Academy are exploring the development of such tools. A small company, Open Remote, has developed a dashboard to bring all the bring information together in an accessible format. : ‘It has been built in such a way that new applications can easily be added.’ A mobile phone app has been developed that presents key information in an accessible manner. This app can be used by the police on the street and by the security of the bars on Stratumseind. In addition, a technology has been developed to control the effectors: the same app that provides information to the police and security can also be used to steer the light on the street. Technologies are leading in this approach and surprisingly little has been thought about who is to use and control these technologies (). For some sensors this is quite clear. The local government can use the data about noise to plan its garbage collection and to inspect events and bars. Citizens can use the data also to inspect whether events remain within the legal noise levels. For most of the other sensors, however, this is much less clear. Information about numbers could be used by various actors for various goals but no clear usage patterns have been developed or even planned yet. In that sense, the practice is really a living lab: ideas are being developed and organizational embedding is to follow later. This description highlights that a technological system is being constructed that consists of a variety of sensors, effectors and controls. The objective of this system is to control the behavior of visitors to the area. This system is a ‘living lab’ in the sense that different components are loosely connected and they are added to the system if they provide additional value. The intensive use of technologies is such an experimental setting is quite unique and raises the question how the different actors came to develop this socio-technical practice. .. Understanding the Living Lab Stratumseind from four perspectives Different perspectives on governance can be used to analyse how and why these socio-technological practices were developed in the City of Eindhoven. We will apply the four perspectives identified by Bekkers  to develop a rich understanding of the logics behind the construction of this smart street. The rational perspective stresses that plans and programs are important for realizing governance goals. An important role for reaching the stated goals is played by the collection of ‘hard’ and ‘objective’ data (, , ). Within the ‘Basecamp’ activities of the Living Lab, these data are collected from as much sources that are available. And also on as many issues that possible are related to safety and liveability. An underlying implicit assumption, is that guaranteeing safety is better understood if these (baseline) data are collected and are related to each other. This kind of assumptions are characteristic for the rational perspective on governance. The data are used for measuring the effects that interventions have in practice and they should lead to a more predictable planning of emergency services. For an important part, the choice for light intervention can also be seen from this perspective. It is about exploring light scenarios which refer to possibilities to intervene in safety on the street by changing the colour and intensity of the streetlights (). In essence the assumption is that interventions based on the collection of different kinds of data, lead to a decrease in the number of safety incidents. So, fitting within the rational perspective, the idea that is widely shared among the participants is that more information leads to better governance. The political perspective provides important additional insights into the dynamics of the Living Lab Stratumseind. The key stakeholders each have a different interest in this project and they try to win others for their ideas through strategic actions. For the municipality the project is mostly about safety and also a bit about liveability of the area (, , ). The interest for the residents is mainly liveability while economic viability is the main interest of the owners of the buildings and of the entrepreneurs that are exploiting the bars (, , ). Each actor alone is not able to reach its own goal independent of the others. Although the actors managed to see the shared interest, there was still the problem with money: it turned out that financing the initiative was a problem with just the municipality and the entrepreneurs on board (). This changed when the university was able to get funding for their research on the effects of light on aggression. This opportunity opened up the way for a close cooperation between the different stakeholders. Looking back it can be concluded that with the funding also a policy window opened that made the development of the Living lab possible. There was no struggle over scarce resources since external money provided the ‘oil’ for collaboration in the Living Lab Stratumseind. The cultural perspective, aimed at sense-making and creating a learning environment provides additional insights. The Living Lab Stratumseind can be seen an initiative in which a number of different stakeholders develop a shared understanding of the mechanisms that determine a successful approach of safety and liveability. It is not by coincidence that an appealing name like ‘Living Lab’ was chosen. It expresses that this project is a learning environment in which the different stakeholders, in close interaction with each other, have to find out what works well and what does not work and in what kind of circumstances an intervention can be successful. The name Living Lab, but also the used labels like ‘Basecamp’ and ‘Engine Block’ are not only well chosen names, but at the same time they are associated with powerful images that make clear what this project is about. In combination they express that the different involved organizations share a learning process together. A close cooperation of many different organizations is necessary to reach the ultimate goal: a safer and more attractive street (, , ). This kind of activities is the focus of the so-called ‘Engine Block’. Even more, it is explicitly pointed out that this part of the Living Lab is aimed at ‘actively create and support the idea of community building’. Finally, building a common understanding is an important aspect of the cultural perspective. Within the case, ICT is used as a crowbar to build such a common understanding. Some respondents pointed out that the main value of using sensors and Big Data in this Living Lab is not so much of a technological nature (, ). In the Living Lab, these technologies are primarily used as instruments to help the different involved stakeholders to build a shared understanding of what they want for this street. Finally, the institutional perspective provides some insight into the role of rules. The Living Lab is an innovative project that takes place in a relatively shielded environment but even in such an innovative environment, some institutions cannot be ignored. Although it is all about innovation in this living lab, some important procedures and rules that are associated with the use of ICT have to be followed. This is especially true for matters that have to do with themes that are important in our Rule of Law like for example ethics or privacy (). When it comes to linking data it is very important that the prevailing rules and opinions are applied in a decent way. To guarantee this, the Living Lab makes use of specific knowledge on the area of ICT and Law that is available within a research centre of Tilburg University. By doing so the Living Lab articulates that certain legal themes are important for the acceptance and future use of the innovations that are developed in the lab. At the same time, the number of rules that actors need to work with in this shielded environment is limited and provide room for experimentation. The analysis highlights that the construction of a living lab helps the actors to develop forms of collaboration that are less hindered by path dependencies and existing rules. . Conclusions: Quantified Street Stratumseind can be characterized as a Quantified Street: enormous amounts of data are being collected to generate not only more safety but all kinds of other outcomes such as more consumers in the area and a higher consumption of beer. Smart governance in this quantified street showed patterns of goal-shifting: new goals were added on the basis of an analysis of what the data could do. In addition, this socio-techno practice illustrates Morozov’s idea of ‘informationism’ . The dominant reasoning behind the approach is that more information will result in better urban governance. There is surprisingly little attention for the question whether the safety problems – and all the other issues – are due to a lack of information. In the cybernetic perspective on governance information gathering is seen as the key to success. This practice illustrates the emphasis on concentrated intelligence rather than distributed intelligence. There is some but surprisingly little attention for active input from citizens and stakeholders in safety governance. Most technology is used to ‘objectively’ collect data about practice that are in one way or another relevant for smart safety governance. This research identified governance practices that could be described as next generation surveillance. The basic idea behind this form of surveillance is that continuous – and maybe even predictive – control is possible through full information and sophisticated interventions. The metaphor of a ‘governance cockpit’ best catches the key features of this approach to urban safety. The social environment is observed through a variety of technologies and the information that is gathered forms the basis for interventions. There is little attention for (communicative) interaction with society. The ideal is one of subtle and unnoticed influence: less violence and crime due to adequate use of light, smell and gaming interventions based on rich information about the crowd and contextual conditions. Subtle forms of surveillance are connected to sophisticated forms of intervention to create a seamless safe environment. One could argue that this type of surveillance is attractive and brings us safe cities but there is also reason for concern about the desirability of this type of safety that is created for citizens rather than with citizens. The cybernetic perspective is about steering and control and largely ignores the idea that community engagement and police-community relations are at the heart of building a safer environment for the long term . Visitors to the Stratumseind are conceptualized as ‘objects’ to be observed and steered rather than as ‘subjects’ that government interacts with. This approach is largely in line with findings in the literature on surveillance that highlights that government agencies aim to obtain maximum information in order to be able to intervene more intelligently . An interesting difference with many previous examples is that different actors such as companies and universities are involved in developing the living lab. Surveillance in the smart city should not be understood as a government practice but rather as a collaborative practice where all actors benefit from collecting data about citizen activities (see also ). The governance analysis showed how a varied set of actors – the municipality, Philips, smaller companies, the university and local entrepreneurs – came to collaborate and to develop this type of sociotechnological practice. The rational perspective showed that these actors shared the idea that more information result in better governance, the political perspective highlighted that external funding facilitated collaboration since money was no longer a scarce resource, the cultural perspective showed that technology became a ‘lens’ for building shared understanding of the street and the institutional perspective showed that the relative absence of rules created the room for building innovative practices. These favorable conditions in a city that ‘loves’ technology provided the setting for this smart street experiment. Remarkable absentees in the collaboration for urban safety are the citizens that visit this area. They were studied but played no role in the collaborative process. At the same time, there were no signs of resistance or protest against the next generation surveillance practices based on new technologies and network collaboration. These citizens seem to have so much faith in the use of new technologies and support the stated goals of a safe street that they do not object to the fact that they are being turned into the objects of this sophisticated surveillance experiment. They seem to be happy to pay this price for urban safety. This observation runs counter to the idea that citizen engagement is only becoming more important and that citizens want to have an influence on their own neighborhood. The contrasting image of the happily passive citizen is provocative and not yet well developed in the literature. This explorative research calls for more research to understand the nature of smart urban safety governance. Further research is needed to investigate to what extent this form of smart urban safety governance is becoming dominant in practices of urban governance. Comparative research of practices of smart governance of urban safety in cities around the world in needed to investigate whether the practices that we identified indeed represent a broader trend. More specifically, the position of citizens as objects rather than subjects of urban safety needs to be investigated more in depth. In-depth qualitative – possibly even ethnographic – research is needed to study how the role of citizens in urban safety changes. Finally, addition research is also needed into surveillance as a collaborative practice. International comparative empirical research can show to what extent companies and academic institutes collaborate with governments to develop high-tech collaborative surveillance practices. This explorative research has portrayed the contours of one specific quantified street in the Netherlands and further research is needed to test the generalizability of these findings. .

Introduction\\n      \\n        The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for urban safety has a long history.\\nThe notion of surveillance has been dominant in these analyses [\\n        30\\n        ]. Some authors have focused on\\nClosed Circuit Television Systems (CCTV) and technologies for analysis of video material [\\n        1\\n        ] and,\\nmore recently, new research has focused on the use of communication media for engaging citizens in\\nthe coproduction of safety [\\n        2\\n        ]. The research on cameras, surveillance technology and social media has\\nprovided important insights in new forms of surveillance – or sousveillance – in an information age\\nbut current developments require new attention. The new wave of technology integrates various sorts of\\ntechnologies (cameras, noise sensors, social media analyses) and used advanced forms of data analysis\\nto obtain relevant information and insights. These technologies are not only used in a centralized control\\nroom but also by networks of public and private actors that are engaged in the production of safety.\\nNew technologies and new forms of governance result in the promise of what can be referred to as\\n‘smart governance’: the smart use of new technologies by networks of actors to make cities safer. At the\\nmoment, however, our empirical knowledge about these new – smart – surveillance practices is limited.\\nThis paper, therefore, aims to explore how this promise of urban safety through advanced technology\\nactually works out in practice and to explore the benefits and pitfalls of smart governance for urban\\nsafety.\\n      \\n      \\n        Rodriquez Bolivar and Meijer indicate that smart governance entails the use of ICTs for internal and\\nexternal collaboration in government to realize societal value [\\n        31\\n        ]. This paper investigates smart\\ngovernance empirically through an in-depth case study of practices of a ‘quantified street’ in the Dutch\\ncity of Eindhoven. In this city, the hometown of the lighting company Philips, one street is full of new\\ntechnologies to make it safer and cleaner. A collaboration between the city government, technology\\nproducers, knowledge institutes and owners of bars and restaurants uses new technologies – noise\\ndetection, cameras, twitter analyses, data analysis – for instantaneous monitoring to make a busy night area\\nin Eindhoven into a safer and more pleasant environment. These new practices take the form of a living\\nlab that explores the possibilities of this wide range of new technologies. We conceptualize this smart\\nstreet as a socio-technical practice since it consists of technologies, roles, organizations, rules, etc. This\\npaper analyzes these practices to enhance our understanding of how technologies are used to enhance\\nurban safety. Our main research question is: how and why is a variety of new technologies used to\\nconstruct a smart street? The answer to this questions will shed some light on the benefits and pitfalls of\\nsmart governance and provide the basis for a more specific research agenda into these new collaborative\\nsurveillance practices.\\n      \\n      \\n        The academic relevance of this paper is twofold. This first ambition of this paper is to realize a\\nsystematic description of the new technologies that are used for smart governance of urban safety. The new\\nuses of technology for producing urban safety are rapidly emerging but academic research has not yet\\nprovided a systematic description: there is a need for theory-based systematic academic descriptions of\\nsmart governance of urban safety. We will use the literature on cybernetics [\\n        3\\n        ], crowd management [\\n        4–6\\n        ],\\nsurveillance [\\n        1,7\\n        ] to position these evolving socio-technological practices. This analysis contributes to\\nthe emerging body of literature on smart city governance [\\n        8,9\\n        ] and (urban) surveillance [\\n        1\\n        ] by analyzing\\na smart street and showing how this can be understood as a complex cybernetic system. The second part\\nof the description is explanatory and aims to construct a theoretical understanding of the governance\\nchoices and emerging technological practices. The literature either presents smart governance as an\\ninstrumental approach to realize governance objectives or criticizes the neo-liberal foundations of these\\nnew forms of governance. An analysis that is based on a more sophisticated understanding of\\ncollaboration in the public sector is lacking. Building upon the four perspectives on governance developed\\nby Bekkers [\\n        10\\n        ], we will analyze the development of the smart street from different angles. These\\nperspectives help to develop a rich account of the logics that have guided the development of the smart\\nstreet. This contributes to the growing understanding of smart city practices as resulting from specific\\ncognitions, interest, institutions and values rather than being inevitable outcomes of technological\\ndevelopment [\\n        31,32\\n        ].\\n      \\n      The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 and 3 present the descriptive and explanatory\\nframeworks for the analysis of the quantified street in the City of Eindhoven. Section 4 presents the research\\nstrategy and the research methods and in Section 5 we will present the case and analyze it with the use\\nof the descriptive and explanatory frameworks. To conclude this article we will reflect on the case and\\ndraw some conclusions in Section 6.\\n    \\n    \\n      2. Cybernetics as a framework for descriptive smart governance\\n      \\n        The literature on smart cities is rapidly expanding [\\n        9,11–14\\n        ]. Even though the term as such is still\\nheavily debated, both technological and critical analyses of smart cities have been published. The basic\\nidea of a smart city is that new technologies can be used to improve life in the city. Smart grids help to\\nmake better use of electrical power, transport systems aim to optimize the use of roads and smart apps\\nprovide tourists with information about sights. While many analyses of the smart city focus on the city\\nas a system, some highlight that we also need to analyze developments at a more specific level. The\\nsmart neighborhood brings us to the level of technology for stronger neighborhoods and the smart street\\ntakes us to the level of a specific street in a city. The (limited) literature on smart street mostly focuses\\non the use of street lights to improve the use of energy and, at the same time, create more safety [\\n        15,16\\n        ].\\n      \\n      \\n        The smart street can, however, also be viewed as a miniature smart city: the same logic applies but\\nat a much smaller scale. The basic argument about the smart city – the use of technologies to measure\\neverything with the aim of intervening more effectively – can also be applied to the street. This would\\nmean that the street turns into a technological street full of sensors to measure what happens on the\\nstreet. The street becomes ‘datafied’: everything that occurs on the street is measured and the data can\\nbe used for new interventions. A street can then be regarded as an urban laboratory to test and develop\\nnew technologies for smart cities [\\n        17\\n        ]. This view on the street as a site for experimenting can help to\\nunderstand the logic of the smart street: a smart street is then not only a means to enhance safety and\\nlivability but also a test ground for new technologies to be applied at a larger scale.\\n      \\n      \\n        A key ideal in the smart street is prevention of criminal activities by creating an environment – in\\nterms of light, smell and gaming opportunities – that is not conducive to criminal activities. The idea\\nof inhibiting crime by changing the environment is not new: classical work on the prevention of crime\\nthrough urban design was already done in the 1970s. Newman [\\n        18\\n        ] highlights how strategies of (de)\\nlimiting movement, defining areas of specific sorts of activities and providing for visual surveillance are\\ncrucial to building a safe neighborhood and these ideas have been enormously influential in urban design\\nand renovation. The specific feature of this approach in smart streets is that the environment is created\\ndynamically by changing the effectors in response to measurements of street conditions.\\n      \\n      \\n        The basic idea of intervening on the basis of measurements in the streets is a cybernetic idea: the street\\nis turned into a cybernetic system. For that reason, the cybernetic perspective can used to describe these\\nemerging socio-technological practices. This type of perspective focuses on the information relations\\nbetween an organization and its environment to study how organizations react towards changes,\\noccurrences or incidents in the environment. Deutsch [\\n        3\\n        ] emphasizes that governance requires information\\nprocessing through sensors and effectors. Sensors are organizational functions – composed of\\ntechnologies, organizational procedures, and organizational positions – that scan the environment for relevant\\ninformation and effectors translate these signals into organizational action by formulating and enacting\\nan organizational reaction. In addition, a control system is needed to coordinate the relation between\\nsensors and effectors. The control function is needed to analyze the information that comes from the\\nsensors and to control the effectors. An overview of the cybernetic model is presented in Fig. 1.\\n      \\n      \\n        The cybernetic perspective is a general perspective on government action but it can used to\\nconceptualize government reaction to safety and security problems. The literature on crowd management\\nemphasizes that processing signals that may indicate (future) problems is crucial to crowd management [\\n        4–6\\n        ].\\nThe literature on crowd management aims to strengthen early warning systems that help the police and\\nother government agencies to act quickly and to prevent or limit safety risks. In addition, the surveillance\\nliterature highlight that government uses a variety of informational means to observe society with the\\naim of being able to realize its policy objectives more effectively [\\n        1,7\\n        ]. The cybernetic perspective can\\nform a basis for systematically describing smart governance.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      3. Four perspectives for understanding smart governance\\n      \\n        The cybernetic perspective is useful for describing the smart street but does not provide the basis for\\ndeveloping an understanding of the emerging smart governance practices. A theoretical perspective is\\nneeded to develop an understanding of how and why specific forms of socio-technical collaboration\\nbetween various actors are being constructed. Translating Bekkers’ [\\n        10\\n        ] perspective on policy-making, we\\ncan distinguish four different perspectives on governance: a rational, a political, a cultural and an\\ninstitutional perspective. The key value of this perspective is that it facilitates us to develop an understanding\\nof new forms of collaboration from different angles: rational choice, power struggles, meaning-making\\nand rule following. These perspectives are not contradictory but help to develop a comprehensive\\nunderstanding of how and why certain forms of collaboration between various actors are being constructed.\\n      \\n      The rational perspective conceptualizes governance as the outcomes of rational analysis. Governance\\nplans and programs are seen as important ‘neutral’ instruments for realizing goals and the choice for\\na specific intervention is explained on the basis of the goals it aims to realize. The rational perspective\\nstresses that an analysis assesses the relation between means to ends. The main criteria for evaluating the\\nsuccess of governance are efficiency, effectiveness and (internal) cohesion. Knowledge and information\\nare very important within this perspective since they are essential to the quality and depth of governance\\nplans. The main idea in this perspective on governance is that better information about a problem and\\nthe effectiveness of interventions will result in better governance. ICT’s are seen as neutral or value free\\ninstruments that could more or less be used ‘of the shelf’ to strengthen governance.\\n      \\n        The political perspective departs from the viewpoint that governance is the result of a trade-off\\nbetween different important values. Power protects or imposes certain stakes and positions or ideas.\\nChoices are not made on basis of a rational analysis but subject to a permanent struggle between actors.\\nThis struggle takes place in arenas or governance networks in which the different actors are\\ninterdependent. Strategic behaviour and the use of power are part of everyday reality. Governance instruments\\nare therefore not neutral but important sources of power that can be mobilized to realise certain\\nadvantages. The most important criterion for the evaluation of governance is stakeholder support and ICTs are\\nnot neutral instruments but symbolic resources that are used strategically to impress relevant\\nstakeholders [19,20, p. 492]. Governance, in this perspective, is not the result of rational analysis but of political\\ninteractions [\\n        21\\n        ].\\n      \\n      \\n        The third perspective on governance that Bekkers discerns is the cultural perspective. Central is the\\nidea that governance is above all sense-making between stakeholders. Governance is seen as a social\\nconstruction that results from the interaction between different stakeholders (see also [\\n        22\\n        ]) and certain\\nmeanings and interpretations are coagulated in governance arrangements. Based on processes of framing\\nand reframing, actors try to build a common understanding. Within this perspective, governance is not\\nonly conceptualised as ‘language’ but also as ‘images’. The main instrument is the organisation of an\\n‘open’ dialogue which can lead to a collective learning process. Whether governance is considered a\\nsuccess depends on the degree in which stakeholders are successful in developing a common, shared\\nunderstanding of the character and the size of the problem at hand and the possible solutions for it.\\nStorytelling is important in bringing order because different realities are connected to each other into a\\nshared reality [\\n        22\\n        ].\\n      \\n      \\n        The last perspective is the institutional perspective. This perspective conceptualizes governance as the\\nresult of a combination of practices, values, rules, routines, conventions and processes that were shaped\\nand made in the past. Because of this, there is not much room for making new choices in governance. In\\nline with the sociological perspective [\\n        23,24\\n        ], Bekkers sees institutions are sets of formal and informal\\nrules that shape the behavior of social actors. These institutions such as the rule of law condition the\\nbehaviour of individual organisations and in this way they contribute to the predictability of their behaviour\\n(see [\\n        23\\n        ]). Information systems can be seen as the embodiment of solidified definitions of reality and\\nitems or issues that are not registered in these systems are therefore seen as not important. Furthermore\\nwithin this perspective it is also important to look at the rules that determine how, in what way,\\nknowledge and information should be shared or exchanged. There are two criteria for determining the level of\\nsuccess of governance: the logic of consequence (focus on efficiency and effectiveness) and the level of\\nappropriateness (legitimacy) (see [\\n        24\\n        ]). Characteristic for this perspective is ‘path-dependency’: a new\\ngovernance approach tends to follows the footsteps of earlier developed and implemented approaches\\nsince switching costs are often high.\\n      \\n      \\n        The perspectives on governance are complementary rather than competing ways of understanding\\nsocial reality [\\n        10\\n        ]. A combination of these perspectives can be used to understand the smart street as\\na socio-technological practice that is constructed on the basis of actor preferences, strategic behaviour,\\nsense-making and (institutional) rules.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      4. Research methods\\n      \\n        This paper explores the topic of smart urban safety governance through an in-depth case study. The\\nselected case should be considered as a most advanced case in terms of use of new technologies for urban\\nsafety [\\n        25,26\\n        ]. The involvement of high tech companies such as Philips and top knowledge institutes\\nsuch as Eindhoven University of Technology makes for innovative use of new technologies. The results\\nof this case can by no means be generalized to other cities and other policy domains but provide insights\\nin new developments that will possibly also play a role in other cities.\\n      \\n      The case study is based on interviews and document analysis. The interviews started with the civil\\nservant who manages the Living Lab Stratumseind (15 May 2014) and proceeded through snow ball\\nsampling. The selection of respondents will be ended when no new names are mentioned by the\\nrespondents. This resulted in nine extensive – often more than two hours – interviews with key participants. In\\naddition to the managers of the Living Lab Stratumseind, the following interviews were conducted: the\\ndirector and an advisor of the key consultancy firm (21 August 2014), the key civil servant of the City of\\nEindhoven (25 August 2014), the responsible alderman of the City of Eindhoven (24 October 2014), an\\nindependent project consultant (14 February 2015), the contact person at Philips (23 February 2015), the\\nprincipal investigator at Eindhoven University of Technology (26 May 2015), the owner of a bar on the\\nstreet (2 December 2015) and a citizen who lives there (3 December 2015). The interviews are referred\\nto with R1, R2, etc.\\n      In addition, we analyzed all the available policy reports and documents. Documents were retrieved\\nboth through the interviews and through an Internet search on the term ‘Living Lab Stratumseind’ on\\nGoogle (20 August 2014). The number of policy documents was surprisingly limited and this may result\\nfrom the fact that in an urban laboratory there is more focus on experimenting than writing policy plans.\\nOur search for relevant documents resulted in three policy documents, three website and one newspaper\\narticle (see list of documents).\\n      \\n        The research started with a reconstruction of the development of the Living Lab Stratumseind over\\ntime. The reconstruction focused on the role of the various actors, their cognitions, their value\\norientations and objectives and their strategies [\\n        27\\n        ]. The respondents were asked to recount the origins and\\ndevelopment of the Living Lab Stratumseind and to reflect on their own role and the roles of the other\\nactors. In addition, the respondents were asked about current practices and the specifics of the various\\ntechnologies used in the living lab. Additional information about current practices was obtained from\\nthe documents. This data collection was structured by a cybernetic focus on signals, sensor, effectors,\\ncontrols and effects [\\n        3\\n        ]. The data were analyzed at the level of the socio-technological practices to\\ndescribe the use of systems and their embedding in the organization. In addition, the data were analyzed on\\nthe basis of the four perspectives on governance to develop an explorative understanding of the choices\\nmade in this process of using a range of new technologies for smart urban safety governance.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      5. Case description and analysis\\n      \\n        5.1. Living Lab Stratumseind 2.0\\n        Eindhoven has developed into a city of 220.000 inhabitants and it is one of the leading actors in\\nwhat is called the Brainport Eindhoven Region, which is considered to be the centre of technology in\\nthe Netherlands. In this city, Stratumseind is one of the most important nightlife areas in the city of\\nEindhoven. It is the longest ‘pub’ street of the Netherlands where you can find over 50 pubs, café’s,\\ndiscotheques and restaurants located in one street. It is well known for many years now, but the last\\ncouple of years Stratumseind faces some challenges that have to be met. Not just with regard to safety,\\nbut also with regard to cooperation and economic viability. That’s why the city of Eindhoven has started\\nthe Stratumseind 2.0 project in which the local authority works closely together with businesses, the\\npolice, breweries, the owners of the real estate property in the street and local residents living on and\\naround Stratumseind.\\n        The main goals of Stratumseind 2.0 are making this specific area more liveable, safer and more\\nattractive for visitors as well as for businesses. In one of the plans it is formulated that Stratumseind should be\\na vital street focused on entertainment in which everyone that is young at heart can find something that\\nhe or she likes, at every day of the week and at every moment of the day (Municipality of Eindhoven,\\n2014). In 2013 the Living Lab Stratumseind (LLS) was started as a part of the Stratumseind 2.0 project.\\nThe LLS has its own angle and scope, but it contributes to the broader goals of this overarching project.\\nThe LLS aims at three broad objectives (Van Gerwen, 2013a & 2013b, R1):\\n1) Collecting facts and knowledge about different aspects that (possible) have to do with the\\nliveability, safety and attractiveness of Stratumseind. With specific measuring equipment anonymous data\\nare collected about the visitors of the street, the surroundings and the local circumstances. By\\nmeasuring and connecting data of f.e. the level of noise, temperature, number of incidents, occupancy\\nrate of parking places, number of visitors and the origin of visitors, a broad pallet of information\\nis created. The data can also be used as a baseline assessment for trying to measure if a certain\\nintervention has any effect in practice.\\n2) Offering a platform for (scientific) research. The street becomes a testing ground for scientific\\nresearch that looks at the influence of light on the behaviour of people (De-escalate project). The\\nexpectation is that the intensity and perhaps also the colour of the light used in public spaces will\\nhave a positive effect on the possible aggressive behaviour of people in a street. With the results\\nfrom the living lab substantiated choices can be made with regards to the appropriate scenarios of\\nthe use of light for a better and safer experience of the visitors of Stratumseind. This can be done\\nin a preventive but also in a more reactive way.\\n3) Creating an environment that gives a boost to innovation. This innovation is needed to reach the\\ngoals that are stated in the Stratumseind 2.0 project. Partners of the LLS (entrepreneurs) that have\\nan idea about the way to increase the liveability, safety or attractiveness of Stratumseind can test\\nproducts, equipment, concepts and ideas in real life practice. This initiation role is important for the\\nLLS because this kind of innovations increases the attractiveness of the street. It also broadens the\\nscope of the LLS beyond measuring of data and it helps to make clear that the LLS is not just about\\nsafety alone. Examples of this kind of innovations are the use of big interactive display panels on\\nthe street and the development of apps like for example ‘pub advisor’ and ‘Feedback Stratumseind’.\\nFor some of these innovations the lab works closely together with other organizations like students\\nof the Fontys University of Applied Sciences.\\n        Two metaphors were developed to describe what the living lab is about (R1; Municipality of\\nEindhoven, 2014); the ‘basecamp’ and the ‘engine block’. The ‘basecamp’ (also referred to as ‘board\\ncomputer’ or as ‘measuring station’) refers to the fact that by using sensor technology on Stratumseind as\\nwell as external information from different kind of sources, a lot of data is collected about lots of\\ndifferent aspects regarding the liveability, safety and attractiveness of Stratumseind. These data is brought\\ntogether so that different kinds of analysis can take place. These kind of baseline measurements will then\\nbe used to predict the behaviour of the ‘crowd’. They are also needed to evaluate specific interventions\\naimed at changing the behaviour of visitors. The image of the ‘Engine block’ is the second metaphor\\nused by the lab manager to describe the way in which the LLS operates. R1 highlights that this metaphor\\nmeans that the living lab also has the function of initiator for renewal and innovations in the area. Within\\nthe network associated with the LLS new ideas about the development of Stratumseind can be\\ngenerated. The engine block function of the LLS means that this living lab is supposed to actively create and\\nsupport the idea of community building among people that can contribute to innovation.\\n      \\n      \\n        5.2. Describing the Living Lab Stratumseind from a cybernetic perspective\\n        While the two metaphors provide insight in how the participants view the living lab, the cybernetic\\nperspective can be used to describe the socio-technological practices in Living Lab Stratumseind from a\\nmore systematic perspective as a cybernetic system consisting of sensors, effectors and controls.\\n5.2.1. Sensors\\n        A broad range of sensors are used in Eindhoven. Cameras have been positioned at the five entranced\\nof Stratumseind. The video images are not preserved but they are used to count numbers of people.\\nSpecific software is used to convert the video images in information about the number of visitors to\\nthe area. Wireless noise detectors have been positioned at the same five positions as the cameras. The\\ndata from these detectors can be used to generate a three dimensional image of the noise in the area.\\nIn addition, light sensors for measuring light intensity are planned to be positioned at two or three\\npositions. When a mobile phone has chosen to open its access to Bluetooth or wifi, a macadres reader can\\nread the telephone’s unique code. Five readers have been positioned at the same places as the cameras\\nand the sound detectors and since these readers work up to 150 meters, the whole area is covered.\\nSocial media analysis is also part of the living lab. In collaboration with a commercial firm, a web\\ncrawler has been developed to search for tweets and posts with search strings such as ‘Stratumseind’,\\n‘Stratum’ and the names of the bars. The software analyzes these tweets to generate a sentiment analysis\\nwhich indicates whether the posts are generally positive, negative or neutral. The perceptions of the\\ninhabitants of the neighborhood will be measured on a weekly basis with a digital survey. This survey\\nis meant to measure the subjective perceptions of the situation on Stratumseind. In addition, data about\\nwhereabouts of mobile phones are purchased. Aggregate and anonymized data about the town where\\npeople live are bought from Vodaphone. These data provide insights in the origins of the visitors to\\nStratumseind. The department Intelligence of the Eindhoven police provides the police reports about\\nStratumseind. Respondent 1 – the project manager – would like these to be more specific to know where\\nexactly incidents took place but he thinks this will demand to much from police reporting. Data from the\\ngarages in the area provide information about traffic flows at certain times and number of visitors who\\ngo to Stratumseind by car. The Municipal Cleaning Department provides information about the amount\\nof waste and glass collected at Stratumseind per day. The beer breweries who provide the beer to the\\nbars provide information about the beer consumption. The public events calendar provides insight in\\nspecific events in the city that may have an impact on the number of visitors or the timing of their visit to\\nStratumseind. This list is not complete since other open data from the city such as counts of the numbers\\nof cyclists can also be used to monitor Stratumseind.\\n      \\n      \\n        5.2.2. Effectors\\n        A variety of technological effectors is used to improve urban safety. The first one is light (color and\\nintensity). Twenty-eight lamps have been positioned in Stratumseind to influence the behavior of visitors\\nthrough their color. These lights can be directed at the level of the individual LED. The second one\\nis smell. The possibility to influence people through smell has been explored with a small company\\n(Smartnose). This company wanted the LLS to pay the development of an application and therefore this\\noption has not yet been developed any further. The third one is gaming. The idea is that games might\\ndistract people and move them away from trouble. This idea has not yet been developed. In addition,\\ntraditional intervention through police action can be used to act upon the information that is gathered\\nthrough the various sensors. Interestingly, this line of action has hardly been developed within the context\\nof the LLS.\\n      \\n      \\n        5.2.3. Controls\\n        Various technologies are used for data analysis and visualization for control. Tools for big data analysis\\nhave not yet been developed but the Eindhoven Technological University, the Fontys University and the\\nPolice Academy are exploring the development of such tools. A small company, Open Remote, has\\ndeveloped a dashboard to bring all the bring information together in an accessible format. R1: ‘It has\\nbeen built in such a way that new applications can easily be added.’ A mobile phone app has been\\ndeveloped that presents key information in an accessible manner. This app can be used by the police on\\nthe street and by the security of the bars on Stratumseind. In addition, a technology has been developed\\nto control the effectors: the same app that provides information to the police and security can also be\\nused to steer the light on the street.\\n        Technologies are leading in this approach and surprisingly little has been thought about who is to use\\nand control these technologies (R2). For some sensors this is quite clear. The local government can use\\nthe data about noise to plan its garbage collection and to inspect events and bars. Citizens can use the\\ndata also to inspect whether events remain within the legal noise levels. For most of the other sensors,\\nhowever, this is much less clear. Information about numbers could be used by various actors for various\\ngoals but no clear usage patterns have been developed or even planned yet. In that sense, the practice is\\nreally a living lab: ideas are being developed and organizational embedding is to follow later.\\n        This description highlights that a technological system is being constructed that consists of a variety\\nof sensors, effectors and controls. The objective of this system is to control the behavior of visitors to\\nthe area. This system is a ‘living lab’ in the sense that different components are loosely connected and\\nthey are added to the system if they provide additional value. The intensive use of technologies is such\\nan experimental setting is quite unique and raises the question how the different actors came to develop\\nthis socio-technical practice.\\n      \\n      \\n        5.3. Understanding the Living Lab Stratumseind from four perspectives\\n        \\n          Different perspectives on governance can be used to analyse how and why these socio-technological\\npractices were developed in the City of Eindhoven. We will apply the four perspectives identified by\\nBekkers [\\n          10\\n          ] to develop a rich understanding of the logics behind the construction of this smart street.\\n        \\n        The rational perspective stresses that plans and programs are important for realizing governance goals.\\nAn important role for reaching the stated goals is played by the collection of ‘hard’ and ‘objective’ data\\n(R1, R2, R3). Within the ‘Basecamp’ activities of the Living Lab, these data are collected from as much\\nsources that are available. And also on as many issues that possible are related to safety and liveability.\\nAn underlying implicit assumption, is that guaranteeing safety is better understood if these (baseline)\\ndata are collected and are related to each other. This kind of assumptions are characteristic for the rational\\nperspective on governance. The data are used for measuring the effects that interventions have in practice\\nand they should lead to a more predictable planning of emergency services. For an important part, the\\nchoice for light intervention can also be seen from this perspective. It is about exploring light scenarios\\nwhich refer to possibilities to intervene in safety on the street by changing the colour and intensity of the\\nstreetlights (R7). In essence the assumption is that interventions based on the collection of different kinds\\nof data, lead to a decrease in the number of safety incidents. So, fitting within the rational perspective,\\nthe idea that is widely shared among the participants is that more information leads to better governance.\\n        The political perspective provides important additional insights into the dynamics of the Living Lab\\nStratumseind. The key stakeholders each have a different interest in this project and they try to win others\\nfor their ideas through strategic actions. For the municipality the project is mostly about safety and also\\na bit about liveability of the area (R2, R3, R4). The interest for the residents is mainly liveability while\\neconomic viability is the main interest of the owners of the buildings and of the entrepreneurs that are\\nexploiting the bars (R2, R8, R9). Each actor alone is not able to reach its own goal independent of the\\nothers. Although the actors managed to see the shared interest, there was still the problem with money:\\nit turned out that financing the initiative was a problem with just the municipality and the entrepreneurs\\non board (R5). This changed when the university was able to get funding for their research on the effects\\nof light on aggression. This opportunity opened up the way for a close cooperation between the different\\nstakeholders. Looking back it can be concluded that with the funding also a policy window opened that\\nmade the development of the Living lab possible. There was no struggle over scarce resources since\\nexternal money provided the ‘oil’ for collaboration in the Living Lab Stratumseind.\\n        The cultural perspective, aimed at sense-making and creating a learning environment provides\\nadditional insights. The Living Lab Stratumseind can be seen an initiative in which a number of different\\nstakeholders develop a shared understanding of the mechanisms that determine a successful approach\\nof safety and liveability. It is not by coincidence that an appealing name like ‘Living Lab’ was chosen.\\nIt expresses that this project is a learning environment in which the different stakeholders, in close\\ninteraction with each other, have to find out what works well and what does not work and in what kind\\nof circumstances an intervention can be successful. The name Living Lab, but also the used labels like\\n‘Basecamp’ and ‘Engine Block’ are not only well chosen names, but at the same time they are associated\\nwith powerful images that make clear what this project is about. In combination they express that the\\ndifferent involved organizations share a learning process together. A close cooperation of many different\\norganizations is necessary to reach the ultimate goal: a safer and more attractive street (R2, R3, R5). This\\nkind of activities is the focus of the so-called ‘Engine Block’. Even more, it is explicitly pointed out that\\nthis part of the Living Lab is aimed at ‘actively create and support the idea of community building’.\\nFinally, building a common understanding is an important aspect of the cultural perspective. Within the\\ncase, ICT is used as a crowbar to build such a common understanding. Some respondents pointed out\\nthat the main value of using sensors and Big Data in this Living Lab is not so much of a technological\\nnature (R2, R5). In the Living Lab, these technologies are primarily used as instruments to help the\\ndifferent involved stakeholders to build a shared understanding of what they want for this street.\\n        Finally, the institutional perspective provides some insight into the role of rules. The Living Lab is an\\ninnovative project that takes place in a relatively shielded environment but even in such an innovative\\nenvironment, some institutions cannot be ignored. Although it is all about innovation in this living lab,\\nsome important procedures and rules that are associated with the use of ICT have to be followed. This\\nis especially true for matters that have to do with themes that are important in our Rule of Law like for\\nexample ethics or privacy (R1). When it comes to linking data it is very important that the prevailing\\nrules and opinions are applied in a decent way. To guarantee this, the Living Lab makes use of specific\\nknowledge on the area of ICT and Law that is available within a research centre of Tilburg University. By\\ndoing so the Living Lab articulates that certain legal themes are important for the acceptance and future\\nuse of the innovations that are developed in the lab. At the same time, the number of rules that actors\\nneed to work with in this shielded environment is limited and provide room for experimentation. The\\nanalysis highlights that the construction of a living lab helps the actors to develop forms of collaboration\\nthat are less hindered by path dependencies and existing rules.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      6. Conclusions: Quantified Street\\n      \\n        Stratumseind can be characterized as a Quantified Street: enormous amounts of data are being\\ncollected to generate not only more safety but all kinds of other outcomes such as more consumers in the\\narea and a higher consumption of beer. Smart governance in this quantified street showed patterns of\\ngoal-shifting: new goals were added on the basis of an analysis of what the data could do. In addition,\\nthis socio-techno practice illustrates Morozov’s idea of ‘informationism’ [\\n        28\\n        ]. The dominant reasoning\\nbehind the approach is that more information will result in better urban governance. There is\\nsurprisingly little attention for the question whether the safety problems – and all the other issues – are due to\\na lack of information. In the cybernetic perspective on governance information gathering is seen as the\\nkey to success. This practice illustrates the emphasis on concentrated intelligence rather than distributed\\nintelligence. There is some but surprisingly little attention for active input from citizens and stakeholders\\nin safety governance. Most technology is used to ‘objectively’ collect data about practice that are in one\\nway or another relevant for smart safety governance.\\n      \\n      This research identified governance practices that could be described as next generation surveillance.\\nThe basic idea behind this form of surveillance is that continuous – and maybe even predictive –\\ncontrol is possible through full information and sophisticated interventions. The metaphor of a ‘governance\\ncockpit’ best catches the key features of this approach to urban safety. The social environment is\\nobserved through a variety of technologies and the information that is gathered forms the basis for\\ninterventions. There is little attention for (communicative) interaction with society. The ideal is one of\\nsubtle and unnoticed influence: less violence and crime due to adequate use of light, smell and\\ngaming interventions based on rich information about the crowd and contextual conditions. Subtle forms of\\nsurveillance are connected to sophisticated forms of intervention to create a seamless safe environment.\\nOne could argue that this type of surveillance is attractive and brings us safe cities but there is also\\nreason for concern about the desirability of this type of safety that is created for citizens rather than with\\ncitizens.\\n      \\n        The cybernetic perspective is about steering and control and largely ignores the idea that community\\nengagement and police-community relations are at the heart of building a safer environment for the long\\nterm [\\n        29\\n        ]. Visitors to the Stratumseind are conceptualized as ‘objects’ to be observed and steered rather\\nthan as ‘subjects’ that government interacts with. This approach is largely in line with findings in the\\nliterature on surveillance that highlights that government agencies aim to obtain maximum information\\nin order to be able to intervene more intelligently [\\n        30\\n        ]. An interesting difference with many previous\\nexamples is that different actors such as companies and universities are involved in developing the living\\nlab. Surveillance in the smart city should not be understood as a government practice but rather as a\\ncollaborative practice where all actors benefit from collecting data about citizen activities (see also [\\n        33\\n        ]).\\n      \\n      The governance analysis showed how a varied set of actors – the municipality, Philips, smaller\\ncompanies, the university and local entrepreneurs – came to collaborate and to develop this type of\\nsociotechnological practice. The rational perspective showed that these actors shared the idea that more\\ninformation result in better governance, the political perspective highlighted that external funding facilitated\\ncollaboration since money was no longer a scarce resource, the cultural perspective showed that\\ntechnology became a ‘lens’ for building shared understanding of the street and the institutional perspective\\nshowed that the relative absence of rules created the room for building innovative practices. These\\nfavorable conditions in a city that ‘loves’ technology provided the setting for this smart street experiment.\\n      Remarkable absentees in the collaboration for urban safety are the citizens that visit this area. They\\nwere studied but played no role in the collaborative process. At the same time, there were no signs of\\nresistance or protest against the next generation surveillance practices based on new technologies and\\nnetwork collaboration. These citizens seem to have so much faith in the use of new technologies and\\nsupport the stated goals of a safe street that they do not object to the fact that they are being turned into\\nthe objects of this sophisticated surveillance experiment. They seem to be happy to pay this price for\\nurban safety. This observation runs counter to the idea that citizen engagement is only becoming more\\nimportant and that citizens want to have an influence on their own neighborhood. The contrasting image\\nof the happily passive citizen is provocative and not yet well developed in the literature.\\n      This explorative research calls for more research to understand the nature of smart urban safety\\ngovernance. Further research is needed to investigate to what extent this form of smart urban safety governance\\nis becoming dominant in practices of urban governance. Comparative research of practices of smart\\ngovernance of urban safety in cities around the world in needed to investigate whether the practices that we\\nidentified indeed represent a broader trend. More specifically, the position of citizens as objects rather\\nthan subjects of urban safety needs to be investigated more in depth. In-depth qualitative – possibly even\\nethnographic – research is needed to study how the role of citizens in urban safety changes. Finally,\\naddition research is also needed into surveillance as a collaborative practice. International comparative\\nempirical research can show to what extent companies and academic institutes collaborate with\\ngovernments to develop high-tech collaborative surveillance practices. This explorative research has portrayed\\nthe contours of one specific quantified street in the Netherlands and further research is needed to test the\\ngeneralizability of these findings.\\n    \\n    \\n      7.

       " 'The study addresses the status of a local government body member and a local government employee as a person holding a public function in the meaning of Polish criminal law. In the Polish legal system, a person who holds a public function may be held criminally liable for passive bribery (bribe accepting) defined in Article 229 of the Polish Penal Code. Pursuant to Article 115 § 19 PC, a public officer and persons belonging to several other categories are persons holding a public function, while Article 115 § 13 PC defines the public officer by detailed enumeration of specific persons. Among individuals related to local government, the category of public officers covers council members, employees of the local government administration, unless they only perform support activities, certain other persons who have the authority to issue administrative decisions on the basis of a special provision, as well as employees of the local government audit body. Apart from public officers, the category of persons holding public function related to local government include some other types than councillors, members of local government bodies, and some persons employed at units operating with the use of local government funds at their disposal, provided that such disposal is of a public-law nature. Studies on judicial practice in cases of bribery and corruption do not yet provide data that would allow for a precise determination of the scale of corruption in local government, but there can be no doubt, that passive bribery committed by local government people is not a minor phenomenon.',\n",

       " '-  Introduction The correct operation of local government relies on a number of factors, including criminal-law response to pathologies. This study concerns local government body members and local government employees as passive bribery offenders under Polish criminal law. Polish criminal law provides for two complementary types of bribery: active and passive. Active bribery in its basic type is defined in Article  §  of the Act of  June , the Penal Code, consolidated text: Journal of Laws of , item  as amended (hereinafter referred to as the Penal Code or PC) as a conduct involving the granting or promise of granting a financial or personal benefit to a person holding a public function in connection with holding this function, but it must be related to the function that this person performs. The perpetrator is subject to the penalty of imprisonment for the period of  months to  years. The basic type of passive bribery is defined in Article  §  PC. The penalty of imprisonment for a period of  months to  years is imposed on a a person who, due to the performance of a public function, accepts a financial or personal benefit or promise thereof. This issue is the subject of numerous studies in Polish subject literature. There are a number of studies. The older works of A. Spotowski (Spotowski ) and M. Surkont () have largely lost their relevance. However, there are newer monographs by C. Nowak () , P. Palka () , M. Iwański () , T. Kanty () , numerous articles and some commentaries to PC. The query reveals serious differences of opinion regarding the understanding of the definition of a person holding a public function, which means the need for further research in this regard.  Methodology The study does not cover the analysis of statutory criteria of passive bribery in the basic type and in numerous modified types, contained in Article  §  to §  PC. It is supposed to determine to what extent an employee of local government in the Republic of Poland may be a perpetrator of active bribery, and therefore to what extent can be considered a person holding a public function within the meaning of Article  PC. To achieve this goal, the classic formal and dogmatic method was used as the prevailing methodology. It has been employed to analyse legal regulations regarding the notion of a person holding a public function. The results of case file research on passive bribery in some categories of local government employees was presented as auxiliary research material. Analysis of the problem The Penal Code of  in its original version used the notion of a person holding a public function as an offender of certain crimes, but did not define it. It contained a definition of a public officer (Article  §  of the Penal Code), which was the subject of performance of a number of criminal offences, e.g. an active assault on an officer (Article  PC) or impersonation of an officer (Article  PC). Because, at the same time, Article  PC used the concept of a person holding a public function, there were doubts as to the relationship between both concepts. To eliminate these doubts, the Act of  June  amending the Act - Penal Code and some other acts (Journal of Laws , item ) defined in Article  §  PC the concept of a person holding a public function. A person holding a public function is a public officer, member of a local government body, person employed with an organisational unit which holds public funds, unless the person concerned only performs support activities, as well as another person whose rights and obligations in the field of public activity are specified or recognized by law or an international agreement to which the Republic of Poland is a party. It should be noted here that the previous doubts have not been dispelled and even new ones have arisen (Nowak , p. ) . This is not the place for a detailed presentation of the historical development of regulations relating to bribery. It should be emphasized, however, that the indicated Act of  June  was a breakthrough. This Act did not fundamentally change the regulation model, which falls within the scope of the standard according to which the definition of the perpetrator of passive bribery is the scope of duties of a person holding a public function, and not the formal name of function. Therefore, the Polish model of responsibility for passive bribery can be described as broad, as opposed to the narrow model in which the relationship of the bribe with the undertaking of specific actions by person holding a public function is needed (Iwański , p. ). Article  §  PC stipulates that all persons classified as public officers are also persons holding a public function. Therefore, the analysis should be started with a casuistic definition of public officer under Article  §  PC. The provision mentions the President of the Republic of Poland, a member of the Sejm, a senator, local council member and a member of the European Parliament. The second group comprises persons related to the judiciary: a judge, juror, public prosecutor, officer of a financial body for preparatory proceedings or its superior body, notary, bailiff, probation officer, insolvency administrator, judicial supervisor, administrator, an adjudicating member of a disciplinary authority acting under a statutory provision. The third group is related to administration. It includes central government or local government personnel, employees of another state body, unless they perform only support functions; persons who, under a specific provision of law, have the power to issue administrative decisions, to the extent to which they are authorise to issue them. The fourth group is those in a managerial position in another state institution. The fifth is the officers of an authority established in order to protect public security. In addition, public officers include Prison Service officers, employees of State inspection bodies or local government inspection bodies and persons in active military service. Of the first of the above mentioned groups, the focus of this study is on the local council member. For the second group, since the Act of  November  on local government personnel (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of , item ) this concerned a disciplinary body adjudicating member, but this Act abolished the disciplinary liability of local government employees ( Giętkowski  , p. ). The third group includes local government administration personnel, unless they only perform support activities. There is also another person to be considered from this group, who, under a specific provision, has the power to issue administrative decisions. These are certainly not members of the fourth group, but rather those in the fifth for which the status of officers of bodies appointed to protect public security should be considered. Other persons include employees of a local government inspection body. Certainly, the group of public officers comprises members of the municipal council, poviat (county) council and regional assembly (Article  of the Act of  March  on municipal self-government, consolidated text: Journal of Laws of , item , as amended, Article  of the Act of  June  on poviat government, consolidated text: Journal of Laws of , item ;  of the Act of  June  on regional government, consolidated text: Journal of Laws of , item ). The status of public officer is acquired by a local council member upon taking the oath at the first session of the newly elected council, and terminate at the end of his term of office, unless there are circumstances giving rise to the early termination of the mandate such as: failure to make a declaration on assets on time, giving up the mandate, violation of the prohibition of combining the position held with the functions listed in statutory provisions (incompatibilitas) , loss of passive electoral law (Kanty , pp. – ) . The position of councillors of auxiliary units of the municipality raises difficulties. The Act on municipal government gives the possibility to establish such units in the form of rural communities, settlements, urban districts and towns which do not constitute separate municipalities (Article  of the Act on municipal government). Such units include rural community councils, settlement councils, and urban district councils, respectively. An unusual solution has been provided for the capital city of Warsaw. Article  of the Act on the system of the Capital City of Warsaw of  March  (consolidated text in Journal Of Laws of , item ) provides that the urban district council is the legislative and audit authority for the district. Article  () of the Act stipulates that the regulations concerning members of district councils of the Capital City of Warsaw shall apply accordingly. This is what makes them public officers, not the circumstances pointed to by Kanty that these people are appointed as a result of election, and that the Act directly refer to them as council members (Kanty , p. ). There are no grounds to consider members of rural community councils as public officers. Pursuant to Article () of the Act on Municipal Self-Government, the council supports the activities of the village leader, and has no legislative powers, unlike the urban district council and settlement council, therefore urban district council and settlement council members of the district may be considered council members within the meaning of Article  §  PC, while members of rural councils may not (Kanty , p. ) . Article () of the Act on municipal government stipulates that the legislative body in an urban district (settlement) is the council of this unit, while Article () provides that the statutes of the settlement may stipulate that the legislative body for the settlement is a general meeting of residents. Therefore, the urban district council member is a public officer, and the settlement council member is a public officer if the settlement\\'s statute does not provide that the general meeting of residents is its legislative body. Certainly, in a situation, in which the general meeting of residents is the legislative body, residents do not become councillors. In accordance with Article () of the Act on municipal government; Article () of the Act on poviat government; Article  of the Act on voivodeship government) a council member,due to the exercise of his mandate, enjoys legal protection provided for public officers. The reason behind this, stated in the literature, is the need to provide council members with protection against negative effects of their actions ( Leoński  , p. , Matyjek , pp.  - ). It is not very clear, as Article  §  PC explicitly recognises the council member as an officer, so it is pointless to establish additional protection. It may even cause faulty interpretations, like the one stated under Article  §  of the Act of  February  Notary Public Law (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of , item  as amended), which contains an identical regulation. Based on this provision, a position was expressed that the notary enjoys the legal protection provided for public officers but the notary himself is not a public officer within the meaning of the Penal Code, as far as his criminal responsibility is concerned, since Article  §  of the Notary Public Law constitutes a lex specialis with respect to Article  §  PC. ( Redelbach  , p. , see also Górski  , p. ). This view, if accepted, would also apply to a council member. It is, nonetheless, incorrect. Since the criminal law defines this term for its own use, the use of definitions and terms contained in other normative acts is neither necessary nor justified (Giezek , p. ) . The most important group is local government personnel, unless they perform only support functions. This regards primarily employees of local government bodies. These bodies are the Municipal Council and the Mayor (village mayor, town mayor, city president) at the municipal level (Article () of the Act on municipal government), the Poviat Council and the Poviat Board at the poviat (county) level (Article () of the Act on poviat government), the Regional Assembly and the Regional Board at the voivodeship (regional) level (Article  of the Act on regional government). As regards these councils, it should be noted that this does not concern council members who are either way public officers, since Article  §  PC expressly mentions them, but persons employed in the offices to support the work of councils. This group refers, after all, to employees, i.e. persons who provide work within the meaning of the Act of  April  the Labour Code (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of , item , as amended). Article  §  of the Labour Code stipulates that the employee is a person hired under an employment contract (see Daniluk , p. ) . The council member is not such a person, since the relevant legislation provides for incompatibilitas, e.g. pursuant to Article  () of the Act on municipal government, the employment relationship in the municipal office in which the councillor obtained the mandate may not be established, and if an official obtains the mandate of a council member, he is obliged to apply for unpaid leave (, p. ) . Therefore, it is not about councillors, but persons providing work for the municipal, poviat and regional bodies (Dolnicki , p. ; Judgement of the Supreme Court of  June , II KK /, Lex No. ) . Also the authorities of inter-municipal unions and unions of poviats which may be established pursuant to Article  () and Article  () of the Act on municipal government and Article  () of Act on poviat government are rightly pointed out (Daniluk , p. ) . Article  of the Act on local government personnel provides that the provisions of that law apply to local government employees employed in marshal\\'s offices and regional local government organisational units; poviat offices and poviat organisational units; municipal offices, municipal auxiliary units, municipal budgetary units and local government budgetary establishments; offices (or equivalent entities) of local government unions and local government budgetary establishments set up by these unions, as well as offices (or equivalent entities) of administrative units of local government units. These are both employees hired by the local government body itself and those hired by the body\\'s auxiliary apparatus, in the form of, for example, a municipal office, poviat office, marshal\\'s office (Dolnicki , pp.  - ; Daniluk , p. ; Majewski , p. ) . This follows directly from Article  of the Act on local government personnel (Dolnicki , p. ) . This category includes also employees of structures set up within the auxiliary units of the municipality. Employees of urban district offices are thus employees of local government (Dolnicki , p. ) . Local government employees employed in organisational units established by local government bodies to perform their tasks are also local government employees (Kanty  , p. ). These units are established under various legal bases and their organisational form can vary: they can be budgetary establishments, budgetary units or commercial law companies (in particular, see: Dolnicki , p. ) . In the prevailing opinion of local government labour law scholars, there is a tendency to broadly understand the organisational unit within the meaning of Article  of the Act on local government personnel (Szewczyk  , p. ; Góral  , p.  et seq.), which affects the interpretation of Article  §  and §  PC. If an employee is employed with an organisational unit established by a local government unit that has legal personality, it is deemed that the employee is not a local government employee (Dolnicki , p. ) . Employees employed at organisational units that do not have legal personality are local government employees under specific provisions. This applies to e.g. employees of municipal budgetary establishments and local government organisational units of social assistance (Dolnicki , pp.  - ) . An employee of the local government is also a municipal police officer (Kanty , p. ) , but there is a doubt raised in the literature whether he is a public officer also on another basis: as an officer of the body appointed to protect public security. This issue will be discussed in detail below, but it should be noted here that the view that the municipal police officer is not an officer of the body appointed to protect public security is right (Dukiet - Nagórska , p.; Kanty , p. , but differently Garus – Ryba , p. . See also Rogalski , p. ; Szewczyk  p. ) . Persons who are not in an employment relationship and provide services to a local governmental entity under a civil law contract are not employees, hence they are not public officers and persons holding a public function, (Daniluk , p. ) . Local government employees should be classified as public officers and persons holding public functions, but that this does not apply to persons who perform only support activities. The assessment of how to understand support activities will be made further on in this study. As it is rightly noted in the jurisprudence and scholarly opinion, employees of local government appeal boards do not fall into the category of public officers. These are appeal bodies in individual cases in the field of public administration falling within the competence of local government units (Article  of the Act of  October  on local government boards of appeal; consolidated text: Journal of Laws of , item ) , and therefore bodies of second instance in administrative proceedings on matters falling within the competence of local government bodies. Their status is being questioned (Dolnicki , p. ; Tarno , p. ; Skibiński , p. ) . Article  §  point  of the Code of Administrative Procedure (hereinafter referred to as CAP) stipulates that whenever the CAP refers to an administrative body, it is to be understood as a number of bodies which are subsequently listed therein, as well as local government boards of appeal. The fact that the legislature has separated the board of appeal from the aforementioned local government bodies using the phrase \"including also\" means that the board of appeal was included in the category of these bodies only for the purposes of the administrative procedure (Dolnicki , p. ; Skibiński , p. ) . Outside the scope of application of the CAP, they are not local government bodies. Therefore, on the basis of Article  §  and  PC, employees of local government boards of appeal are not public officers or persons holding a public function (decision of the Supreme Court of  June , III RN, /, Wokanda , No. , item ; Daniluk , pp.  - ) . Concerning the persons indicated above, Article  §  PC stipulates that they are officers, unless they perform exclusively support functions. Therefore, performing exclusively support functions means that a given person cannot be a perpetrator of passive bribery. The identification of support activities and whose responsibilities include performing such activities is a kind of core of the analysed definition. Examples of persons performing only support activities include a cloakroom attendant, cleaner, buffet attendants, library employee, security guard (Nowak , p. ; Daniluk , p. , Majewski , p. ) . Departing from the meaning of the adjective \"usługowy\" (service, support) in Polish, it should be stated that it is characterised by a feature of activities aimed at satisfying someone else\\'s needs (Doroszewski, http://www.sjpd.pwn.pl/haslo/us%% gowy/, see also Sobczak  , p. ). However, the purely linguistic meaning is not satisfactory, as support activities are performed, in a sense, by all employees of the administration, including local government: after all, they satisfy specific needs of citizens. This means that it must be about something else. The view that these are activities that do not fall within the substantive competence of a given authority, which are of an auxiliary nature in terms of needs indirectly related to the functioning of the authority or unit (Majewski , p. ; Daniluk , p. ) is correct. This gives rise to somewhat ambiguous conclusions with respect to certain types of activities. For example, under Article  of the Act of  December  on municipal management (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of , item , as amended), the provisions on local government personnel shall apply to employees of budgetary establishments, unless specific provisions provide otherwise. This means, pursuant to Article  §  and §  PC, that they are officers and persons holding a public function if they perform activities other than support activities, i.e., those which fall within the substantive competence of the establishment. With regard to a municipal public utility provider, it should be considered that the activities which fall within the scope of its substantive jurisdiction are e.g. street cleaning, waste collection, etc. This, in turn, makes it necessary, nolens volens, to assume that a cleaner employed at such an establishment is a public officer and is subject to special protection during and in connection with the performance of his official duties consisting in street cleaning, and - being at the same time a person holding a public function - if he accepts a financial or personal benefit or a promise thereof in connection with his function, he meets the statutory criteria of active bribery as defined in Art.  of the Penal Code. This is highly unfortunate, but it results from the very broad approach to the notion of public officer as defined in Article  §  PC. However, the sharpness of this regulation is blunted by the provision of Article  § PC, according to which a prohibited act, the social harm of which is insignificant, does not constitute a criminal offence. In most cases of accepting a benefit or its promise due to the actions of such an officer, one should even speak about the lack of social harmfulness of the act rather than its insignificance. Article  §  PC states that also another person is a public officer, to the extent to which the person is entitled to issue administrative decisions. These are persons who operate within other self-governments than local government, e.g. professional self-government organisations of advocates, medical practitioners (Kanty , p. ; Surkont , p. ) , or attorneys-at-law. Therefore, this group remains out of the scope of our interest. The fifth group of public officers included the officers of a body established to protect public security and public order. This protection is the task of the central administration (Kotowski , p. , Osierda , p. ) . As regards local government, the issue of ensuring public security and order is of a secondary nature. Whereas Article  () of the Act on municipal government provides that, to the extent not regulated in separate laws or other generally applicable provisions, the municipal council may issue law enforcement provisions if necessary for the protection of citizens\\' life or health and for ensuring public order, peace and security, which means that it has tasks in this field. However, Kanty rightly notes that this does not make the municipal council such a body within the meaning of Article  §  PC, since the security task in question does not involve performing such activities directly (Kanty , p.  – ) . case ref. no. II KZP /, Orzecznictwo Sądów Polskich , no. , item ). The view was then changed, considering that the municipal police was supposed to protect public order, not security (decision of the Supreme Court of  September , case ref. no. I KZP /, Orzecznictwo Sądu Najwyższego Izby Karnej i Wojskowej , vol. , item ) . The only point of attachment for the older view may be Article  () of the Act on municipal police stipulating that the maximum working time of the municipal police officer may be exceeded where it is required to take measures to protect the life or health of citizens, as well as the security of the community, in particular the general threat to public security, catastrophe, natural disaster or terrorist offence. It follows from the provision that the municipal police is required to take action in connection with the protection of public security. This can lead to the conclusion that it is a service established to provide security. However, Kanty rightly points out that the fact that a given service is obliged to act, inter alia in the event of a security risk, does not alter the fact that it is established to protect order (Kanty , p. ) . The municipal police officer is not a public officer under a provision concerning bodies appointed to protect public security, but under another legal basis: as a local government employee, as prejudged by Article  of the Act on municipal police (Dukiet – Nagórska , p. ; Kanty , p. , but differently Garus – Ryba , p. ) . The last group to be classified as officers are persons employed at a local government audit body, unless they perform only support activities. The performance of such activities is discussed above. The mere distinguishing of this group is rightly considered unnecessary as these persons are already public officers by virtue of being employees of the local government (Kanty  , p. ). These are employees of the Regional Chambers of Accounts, which, in accordance with Article  of the Act of  October  on Regional Chambers of Audit (consolidated text: Journal. of Laws of , item ) are the state supervisory and audit bodies for the financial management of local government units. The persons listed above are public officers. They are subject to increased protection provided for in the provisions of Chapter XXIX of the Penal Code addressing offences against the activities of institutions of the State and local government. In accordance with Article  §  PC, a state officer is also a person holding a public function, i.e. a suitable subject of passive bribery. The provision stipulates that the person holding a public function is a public officer, a member of a body of local government, a person employed at an organisational unit which has public funds at its disposal, unless the person performs only support activities, and another person whose powers and obligations in the scope of public activity are specified or recognised by an act or an international agreement binding on Poland. With regard to a member of a local government body, it should be stated that this concerns various types of self-government, e.g. professional sel-ggovernment (Filar , p. ) . At this point, we are interested in a member of a local government body, though. However, it was stated above with respect to the council member that he is a person holding a public function as a public officer, so it is not about him. As noted above, local government employees are also public officers. However, there are persons other than council members and employees in the local government structures, who perform certain activities on a gratuitous basis. In particular, there are members of auxiliary bodies of the municipal government, e.g. village heads and members of village councils. They have a budg located by the municipal council, which makes it right to classify them as persons holding a public function and thus create the possibility to be held liable for bribery (Kanty , p. , Iwański, p. ) . On the other hand, failure to classify them as officers means that they are not subject to special protection during performing or in connection with their activities. From the point of view of their duties, they are treated in a special way but are not more protected than an ordinary citizen. When analysing the notion of a person employed in an organisational unit operating with public funds, one should start from the notion of public funds. Article  of the Act of  August  on Public Finance (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of , item  as amended) lists public funds in detail. These are public levies and other revenues; revenues from the European Union\\'s budget; non-reimbursable funds from aid granted by EFTA Member States; funds from financial instruments specified in the provisions on the principles of development policy; other non-reimbursable funds from foreign sources; revenues of the state budget and budgets of local government units and other public finance sector units from various financial operations; and finally, revenues of public finance sector units from their activities and from other sources. Therefore, they can be considered as revenues of the state and local government budgets. The view that this covers also such assets as receivables, real properties etc. (judgement of the Appellate Court of Wrocław of  October , II AKa /, Orzecznictwo Sądów Apelacyjnych , vol. , item ; decision of the Supreme Court of  September , I KZP /, Orzecznictwo Sądu Najwyższego Izby Karnej i Wojskowej , vol. , item , Guzik – Makaruk, Pływaczewski , p. ) constitutes an inadmissible extendin g interpretation (Kanty  , p. ). The concept of public funds comprises both the funds allocated to the State Treasury and the local government. The identification which units dispose of public resources requires that it be determined whether there are entities in which there is any contribution of public funds, in this case local government funds, or rather entities with the power to distribute those funds as an exercise of the powers delegated by the local government. Both these concepts are presented in literature and case law. It is sometimes argued that a person employed in an entity holding public funds is, for example, a member of the governing bodies of a housing cooperative, director of a state-owned enterprise, a company in which the share of public capital is at least  %, a state-owned bank (Bojarski, Oczkowski , p. ; Górniok , p.  and vast case law. Doubts are raised by Nowak , pp.  – ) . In opposition to this view, there is a position based on the interpretation of the term \"disposal of public funds\" referring to Article  of the Act on public finance, which refers to the distribution of public funds, clearly indicating that it is about planning the use of the public funds held, that is to say, an act within the limits of sovereign powers. If that activity is carried out by an entity other than a central or local government body, the entity acts towards the achievement of public objectives laid down by law, in place of a particular public body, in this case local government one. It is, therefore, not an economic activity, but administrative one (Kardas , p.  et seq..; Mik , p. ; Kanty , pp.  – , Palka , p. ) . Article  of the Act on public finance states that the public finance sector comprises \" budgetary units, budgetary establishments and auxiliary holdings of budgetary units, special purpose funds and state or local government legal entities, established under separate laws for the performance of public tasks, excluding undertakings, banks and commercial law companies, but not all of these entities are involved in administration (Kardas , p. ) . This may be the case in local-government budgetary units, budgetary establishments and auxiliary holdings, but the determination of whether an entity merely carries out an economic activity or whether its responsibility is sovereign planning on distribution of funds can only be determined on a case-by-case basis. It is likely that most of the entities referred to above are not such entities. The expression which concludes the list contained in Article  §  PC: \"a person whose rights and obligations in terms of public activities are laid down in law or an international agreement binding the Republic of Poland \" raises a number of doubts, but they do not relate to the issue of self-government: this concerns clergymen who officiate clerical weddings with civil-law effects, car diagnosticians, academic teachers, etc. (in more detail Kanty , pp. –) .  Summary The passive bribery offender specified in Article  PC may be a person holding a public function. Pursuant to Article  §  PC, a public officer and persons belonging to several other categories are persons holding a public function. Among individuals related to local government, the category of public officers covers council members, employees of the local government administration, unless they only perform support activities, certain other persons who have the authority to issue administrative decisions on the basis of a special provision, as well as employees of the local government audit body. Apart from public officers, the category of persons holding public function related to local government include some other types than councillors, members of local government bodies, and some persons employed at units operating with the use of local government funds at their disposal, provided that such disposal is of a public-law nature. This approach raises certain doubts. The attempt to define the passive bribery offender in a broad manner in the Act of  June  amending the Penal Code and certain other acts, combined with the pursuit of a precise enumeration of the persons involved, has caused ambiguity. In particular, there are no uniform classification criteria (Nowak , p. ) . This also applies to persons related to local government, as demonstrated above. Studies on judicial practice in cases of bribery and corruption do not yet provide data that would allow for a precise determination of the scale of corruption in local government, and interpretative doubts do not facilitate the evaluation of their results. The study carried out by P. Bachmat in  shows that  out of  randomly chosen passive bribery cases (% of all cases in ) in  concerned the passive bribery committed by a person holding a local government function, with  cases being persons who are undoubtedly within the limits of the above mentioned scope of meaning of a person holding a public function, because once it was a municipal police officer, twice it was officials of a poviat office,  cases concerned a driving examiner in the Voivodeship Traffic Centres, who are local government employees. Teachers, who do not fall into the category of a person holding a public function, were sentenced twice (Bachmat , p. ) . The small number of cases examined under the study does not allow for a full assessment of the phenomenon, but it can be concluded that its scale is quite significant. Of course, the conclusions of these studies can be deceptive. P. Bachmat examined % of cases, i.e.  out of . Finally, it turned out that in   proceedings were initiated, in  – , in  - , in  – , in  - , in  -, in  - , in  – , in  – , in  –  (http://statystyka.policja.pl/st/kodeks-karny/przestepstwa-/,Lapownictwo-bierne-art-.html accessed on March.. ). These are not significant numbers, but on their basis it can be concluded that the conducted research covers few cases and may be affected by errors. Full conclusions can only be drawn from broader research that has not yet been carried out. Not only have the studies conducted so far examined few cases of passive bribery, but have not made use of studies on active bribery (granting a benefit or its promise). There were  such cases in  (Bachmat , p. ) . P Bachmat examined  of them, which is a significant number, and which would enrich not only the knowledge about active bribery but also about passive bribery. After all, each act of granting a bribe entails its acceptance. When examining active bribery, it was not being determined who in the  cases under study the perpetrators gave the benefit or its promise, i.e. who was potentially the perpetrator of passive bribery related to the active bribery. This would have cast more light on the shape of passive bribery. Perhaps it could provide an answer to the question as to why there are  cases of active bribery per  case of passive bribery, when common sense indicates that the numbers should be similar. Cases that have been concluded with final decisions may explain the difference, but this entails a sad conclusion that proceedings against the bribe provider are easier to conclude with a conviction than proceedings against the recipient of the same bribe. From a practical point of view, passive bribery committed by local government people is not a minor phenomenon. From the dogmatic point of view, it can be seen that the definition of the perpetrator raises serious doubts resulting from the adoption of the defective form of enumeration.',\n",
